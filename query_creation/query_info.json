The correlations between leadership role occu\npancyandopenness,conscientiousness,andextraversionwerepositive,\n whereas the correlations between leadership role occupancy and\n agreeableness and neuroticism were negative. Compared with meta\nanalyses that tested the relationship between BFI and emergence\nthe latter measured in part as leadership role occupancy (Barling &\n Weatherhead,2016)–thecorrelationsare mostlyinthesamedirection\n exceptfor agreeableness(e.g., Ensari, Riggio, Christian, & Carslaw, 2011;\n Ilies, Gerhardt, & Le, 2004). In the meta-analysis of Ilies and colleagues,\n for example, agreeableness had a small overall positive correlation (r =\n 0.05), whereas we find a small negative correlation (r = −0.05).\n As a measure of leadership role occupancy, we utilized the question:\n “What is your current profession/What profession did you exercise in\n your last job? (If you are retired, unemployed or currently do not have\n a job: please refer to the last job you had).” We classified individuals\n as occupying a leadership role (10.84%) when they answered the ques\ntion with “higher supervisory profession (e.g. manager, director, owner\n of large company, supervisory civil servant)”.Weclassified individuals\n as not occupying a leadership role when they answered the question\n with one of the following answers: “higher academic or independent\n profession (e.g. architect, physician, scholar, academic instructor, engi\nneer)” (7.71%), “intermediate academic or independent profession\n (e.g. teacher, artist, nurse, social worker, policy assistant)” (29.2%),\n “other mental work (e.g. administrative assistant, accountant, sales as\nsistant, family carer)” (31.8%), “semi-skilled manual work (e.g. driver,\n factory worker)” (8.68%), “unskilled and trained manual work (e.g.\n cleaner, packer)” (9.63%), and “agrarian profession (e.g. farm worker,\n independent agriculturalist)” (2.04%).\" (Section \"Measures\"; p.3)",

In this paper, we guide researchers in the application of machine learning techniques\nto uncover complex relationships. Specifically, we demonstrate how applying machine learning can help to as-\nsess the complexity of a relationship and show techniques that help interpret the outcomes of“black box” ma-\nchine learning algorithms. While demonstrating techniques to uncover complex relationships, we are using\nthe Big Five Inventory and need for cognition to predict leadership role occupancy.

To provide a benchmark against the machine learning models, an \nordinary least squares regression (OLS) model with all the available \nsame predictors (in the same manner as the machine learning models) \nwas included. The multiple OLS acts as a comparator with penalised \nregression models by fitting the data without any regularisation, making \nit prone to overfitting compared to models with regularisation. Addi\ntionally, two other comparison models akin to those used in similar \nresearch were fitted (Buckman et al., 2021a). The first was an OLS \nregression model with only the pre-treatment GAD-7 score included, as \ninitial symptom severity is one of the most important factors considered \nby clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes (and allocating treat\nment) for their patients (Amati et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2021b; \nO’Driscoll et al., 2021). Separately, a null model was created using the \nmean post-treatment GAD-7 score in the training and validation dataset \nas the prediction for all test dataset cases. Five models based upon elastic \nnet regularised regression (ENR; Friedman et al., 2010) were included \n(alpha parameters were 0.0; full ridge, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0; full \nlasso), using the ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection oper\nator (lasso) penalisations to reduce overfitting. Two spline regression \nmodels were used: adaptive splines (Friedman, 1991) and adaptive \npolynomial splines (Stone et al., 1997). In addition, two \ndecision-tree-based algorithms were used: random forest (Breiman, \n2001) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., \n2010). Lastly, three support vector machines (SVM) were included with \nlinear, polynomial and radial kernels (Dimitriadou et al., 2009). Full \ndetails of the models are presented in Supplementary Material 1 \n(Table 3). \nSuperLearner (van der Laan et al., 2007), the chosen ensemble \nmodelling tool, uses cross-validation to estimate the predictive perfor\nmance of individual machine learning algorithms, and ultimately de\ntermines the most accurate model within the ensemble.\" (Section 2.4; p.2)",

To provide a benchmark against the machine learning models, an \nordinary least squares regression (OLS) model with all the available \nsame predictors (in the same manner as the machine learning models) \nwas included. The multiple OLS acts as a comparator with penalised \nregression models by fitting the data without any regularisation, making \nit prone to overfitting compared to models with regularisation. Addi\ntionally, two other comparison models akin to those used in similar \nresearch were fitted (Buckman et al., 2021a). The first was an OLS \nregression model with only the pre-treatment GAD-7 score included, as \ninitial symptom severity is one of the most important factors considered \nby clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes (and allocating treat\nment) for their patients (Amati et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2021b; \nO’Driscoll et al., 2021). Separately, a null model was created using the \nmean post-treatment GAD-7 score in the training and validation dataset \nas the prediction for all test dataset cases. Five models based upon elastic \nnet regularised regression (ENR; Friedman et al., 2010) were included \n(alpha parameters were 0.0; full ridge, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0; full \nlasso), using the ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection oper\nator (lasso) penalisations to reduce overfitting. Two spline regression \nmodels were used: adaptive splines (Friedman, 1991) and adaptive \npolynomial splines (Stone et al., 1997). In addition, two \ndecision-tree-based algorithms were used: random forest (Breiman, \n2001) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., \n2010). Lastly, three support vector machines (SVM) were included with \nlinear, polynomial and radial kernels (Dimitriadou et al., 2009). Full \ndetails of the models are presented in Supplementary Material 1 \n(Table 3). \nSuperLearner (van der Laan et al., 2007), the chosen ensemble \nmodelling tool, uses cross-validation to estimate the predictive perfor\nmance of individual machine learning algorithms, and ultimately de\ntermines the most accurate model within the ensemble.\" (Section 2.4; p.2)",

In this paper, we guide researchers in the application of machine learning techniques\nto uncover complex relationships. Specifically, we demonstrate how applying machine learning can help to as-\nsess the complexity of a relationship and show techniques that help interpret the outcomes of“black box” ma-\nchine learning algorithms. While demonstrating techniques to uncover complex relationships, we are using\nthe Big Five Inventory and need for cognition to predict leadership role occupancy.

We perturbed single predictor variables by randomly changing their values 200 times and keeping all other values constant to calculate the “loss drop” in the test set. The loss drop refers to the increase in the quadratic mean of the difference between the predicted likelihood (ranging from 0% to 100%) and the actual leadership role occupancy (0% or 100%).Note that 11.4% of the individuals in the test set were in a leadership role, which means that if a model were to predict 0% (i.e., no leadership role occupancy) for each individual, the root mean squared error (RMSE) would have been 11.4%. Thus, the RMSE will increase when the perturbations result in a decrease (i.e., drop) in predictive performance.\" (Section \"RQ2a\"; p.6)\n\n\"To further explore the interaction between BFI traits and NFC, we present the RF predictions on the test set against BFI and NFC scores in Fig. 5. In this figure, each person is denoted as either a blue circle or a gray triangle. Blue circles are used when the RF predicts leadership role occupancy (N = 129) and as gray triangles when the RF predicts no leadership role occupancy. As illustrated in Fig. 5, across all interactions, the RF frequently predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals scoring higher (at least 4) on NFC. Further, this higher NFC often resulted in predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals higher on openness (>3.5), conscientiousness (>3.0), and extraversion (>3.0); lower on neuroticism (>3.0); and not too high on agreeableness (<4.5). Note that these findings are largely in line with the accumulated local effects plotted in Fig. 3, in which we visualized the effects of each trait separately.\" (Section RQ2c\"; p.8)\n\n\"The importance of interactions between traits in predicting leadership role occupancy is visualized in Fig. 4a. This figure shows that NFC has the strongest interaction effect (H-statistic), meaning that interactions between NFC and the other traits contribute the most to leadership role occupancy predictions. To better understand the interactions between NFC and the other traits, we computed the H-statistic for each pair with NFC. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the interaction between openness and NFC contributed the most in predicting leadership role occupancy, which we explore next.\" (Section \"RQ2c\"; p. 8)",

Second, in efforts to advance the leader-trait paradigm, we focused on traits. However, several other features such as height and intelligence (Ilies et al., 2004) are important for leadership as well (i.e., variety). Third, we studied the leader trait cross-sectionally and did not focus on changes in the data, such as changes in leadership role occupancy — which would especially be interesting to monitor as changes in contextual factors such as market competition and disruption alter who is preferred as a leader (velocity). Fourth, though our sample is from a trusted source, using validated measures, there is the perennial concern with data quality (i.e., veracity). Scholars will need to remain vigilant when it comes to quality as the hunt for compelling datasets intensifies.\" (Section \"Discussion\"; p. 11)",

While comparing the two models, we offered more flexibility to the RF to fit complexity beyond linear additive effects. Our results suggested that the RF outperformed the LM in the cross-validation step and indicated that the RF had some advantage in predicting leadership role occupancy in the test set. These results suggest that modeling complexity beyond linear and additive effects of traits has some added value in predicting leadership role occupancy (RQ 1), supporting the interactionist accounts of the leader-trait paradigm.\" (Section \"Discussion; p.9)",
