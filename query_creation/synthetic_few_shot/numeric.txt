You are tasked with creating two few-shot examples for a question where the answer is a numeric value.
Rules:
Each example should simulate a short excerpt from a research paper.
Each example should clearly reflect the numeric answer reported in the excerpt.
If the numeric information is not present in the excerpt, the answer should be Z.
Do not invent information outside the excerpt.
Be concise but include enough detail to justify the answer.
Return exactly two examples in the following format:
Example 1:
Extract from paper: <context1/>
True Answer: <numeric_answer1/>
Example 2:
Extract from paper: <context2/>
True Answer: <numeric_answer2/>
Do not include any additional text, explanation, or labels.
Input:
The text following this line is the base prompt (the numeric question with variable, description, and excerpt) for which you should create the two synthetic examples.
