You are tasked with creating two few-shot examples for a list-based classification question about research papers.
Rules:
Each example should simulate a short excerpt from a research paper.
Each example should clearly reflect one or more items that belong in the answer list.
If the excerpt contains multiple correct items, return them as a comma-separated list.
If the requested information is not present in the excerpt, the answer should be "Z".
Do not invent information outside the excerpt.
Be concise but include enough detail to justify the answer.
Return exactly two examples in the following format:
Example 1:
Extract from paper: <context1/>
True Answer: <answer1/>
Example 2:
Extract from paper: <context2/>
True Answer: <answer2/>
Do not include any additional text, explanation, or labels.
Input:
The text following this line is the base prompt (including the task, description, and excerpt) for which you should create the two synthetic examples.
