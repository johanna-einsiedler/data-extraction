Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with **classifying the type of outcome variable** described in a short excerpt from a research paper.

**Context**  
The excerpt (between the markers `Excerpt:` and `End of excerpt`) is the only source of information you may use. Do **not** rely on any outside knowledge or make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated.

**Coding scheme (choose the single best option)**  

| Code | Variable type | Definition (examples) |
|------|---------------|------------------------|
| **1** | **Binary** | Exactly two mutually exclusive categories (e.g., “suicide attempt: yes / no”). |
| **2** | **Nominal categorical** | More than two unordered categories (e.g., “attachment style: secure / anxious / avoidant / disorganized”). |
| **3** | **Ordinal categorical** | Categories with a natural order or rank (e.g., “job level: intern → junior → senior → manager → executive”). |
| **4** | **Continuous** | Measured on an interval or ratio scale with numeric values and meaningful distances (e.g., IQ score, blood pressure). |
| **Z** | **Information not present** | The excerpt provides no indication of the outcome‑variable type. |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Identify any statement that explicitly describes the outcome variable (its scale, categories, or measurement).  
2. **Select the single code** that best matches that description, using the definitions above.  
   - If more than one code could apply, choose the **most specific** one (e.g., if the variable is described as “a 0–1 score” that is binary, not continuous).  
3. **If the excerpt does not mention the outcome variable at all, or the description is too vague to assign a code, answer `Z`.**  
4. **Do not infer, guess, or add information** that is not directly stated in the excerpt.  
5. **Output only the chosen code** (1, 2, 3, 4, or Z). **No extra text, explanations, or punctuation** may be included.

**Edge‑case handling**  

- **Multiple mentions:** If the excerpt lists several outcomes, use the one that is *explicitly* identified as the primary outcome (the first one mentioned).  
- **Quantitative numbers without a scale:** If numbers are given but no scale or categorisation is described (e.g., “participants scored an average of 7.4”), treat this as **Continuous (4)** only if the underlying variable is clearly a measurement (e.g., “score”, “level”). Otherwise, answer `Z`.  
- **Implicit binary wording:** Phrases like “presence/absence of X” count as **Binary (1)**.  
- **Ambiguous ordering:** If categories are listed with a possible order but the order is not stated as meaningful, treat them as **Nominal (2)**.

 “What is your current profession/What profession did you exercise in
 your last job? (If you are retired, unemployed or currently do not have
 a job: please refer to the last job you had).” We classified individuals

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract a single numeric value from the supplied excerpt.  
**Context:** The value must be taken *exactly* as it appears in the text—no calculation, conversion, or interpretation is allowed.

---

### Target Variable  
**“Number of cases (i.e., the outcome to be predicted) in the minority group.”**  
- This is the total count of observations belonging to the class with the **fewest** occurrences in the dataset.  
- If the excerpt reports a count that already includes all validation sets, use that number.  
- If separate counts are given for training, validation, and/or test sets, **add them together** *only* when the excerpt explicitly states that the numbers should be summed to obtain the total minority‑class count.  
- **Do not** infer or estimate a total when the excerpt does not provide a clear, explicit total.

---

### Extraction Rules  

1. **Exact Match** – Return the number exactly as it is written (e.g., “12”, “1 234”, “0.5”).  
2. **Missing or Unclear** – If the excerpt does **not** state the minority‑group case count, or the information is ambiguous (e.g., “few cases”, “approximately”, “around”), answer with the single character **`Z`**.  
3. **No Units or Commentary** – Do **not** include any units, commas, words, or explanatory text. Only the plain numeric string or `Z`.  
4. **No Guessing** – Do not perform any arithmetic unless the excerpt explicitly tells you to sum specific numbers.  
5. **Single Output** – Provide **one** token only (the number or `Z`).  

---

### Optional Reasoning (do not output)  
- If you are uncertain whether a number refers to the minority class, double‑check the surrounding sentences for a clear statement such as “the minority class had X cases” or “the smallest class contained X instances”.  
- If multiple numbers appear, select the one that the text directly links to “minority group”, “smallest class”, or “least frequent outcome”.

Excerpt:
{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify the information contained in a research‑paper excerpt about *hyper‑parameter values used for model tuning* according to the coding scheme below.

**Context:**  
You will be given the excerpt in the placeholder `{context}`.

**Coding Scheme (select **all** letters that apply):**  

| Letter | Meaning |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | The paper does **not** mention hyper‑parameter values at all. |
| **B** | The authors use a **fixed** set of hyper‑parameter values (no tuning). |
| **C** | The paper states that **default** hyper‑parameter values were used, but does not list the values. |
| **D** | The authors **explicitly list** the specific hyper‑parameter values or ranges that were considered for tuning. |
| **E** | **Other** – the excerpt clearly indicates a correct answer that is not captured by A‑D (e.g., a different categorisation). |
| **Z** | None of the above categories apply because the excerpt provides **no relevant information** about hyper‑parameter values. |

**Instructions (follow *exactly*):**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Base your decision **solely** on what is explicitly stated in the text. Do **not** infer, guess, or add information that is not present.  
2. **Select every letter that correctly describes the excerpt.**  
   - If more than one category is true, list the letters in **alphabetical order**, separated by commas (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If a single category applies, output the single letter (e.g., `B`).  
3. **If the excerpt mentions a situation that does not fit A‑D,** include **E** (“Other”).  
4. **If the excerpt contains no mention of hyper‑parameter values or related decisions,** output **only** `Z`.  
5. **Do not provide any explanation, justification, or additional text**—the answer must be **exactly** the list of letters (or `Z`).  
6. **Missing or ambiguous information:**  
   - If the excerpt suggests a modelling decision (e.g., software choice) but does not explicitly state the hyper‑parameter values, treat this as *missing* and apply the appropriate category (A, C, or Z) based on what is actually written.  
   - If the wording is ambiguous and you cannot determine with certainty which category applies, default to the **most conservative** choice (the category that requires the least assumption).

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign the appropriate code‑letter(s) that describe the **method used for hyper‑parameter tuning**. Use **only** the information that is explicitly present in the excerpt.

**Context**  
The excerpt will be supplied in the placeholder `{context}`.

**Coding Scheme**  

| Letter | Meaning (exact wording to use) |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| **A** | “Tuning method not specified, stated that default method was used – The authors do not specify the tuning method and state only that the default procedure of the software was used.” |
| **B** | “Random search – Hyperparameter values are randomly sampled from a predefined range to explore different configurations.” |
| **C** | “Grid search – All possible combinations of predefined hyperparameter values are systematically evaluated.” |
| **D** | “Model‑based optimization – Based on previous results, models are built and iteratively updated to predict performance and prioritize promising hyperparameter configurations.” |
| **E** | “Optimization heuristics – Rule‑based strategies iteratively searching for combinations of hyperparameters.” |
| **Y** | **Other** – The excerpt clearly indicates a tuning method that is **not** described by any of the definitions above. |
| **Z** | **Not reported** – The excerpt contains no information about the tuning method at all. |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify every tuning method that is explicitly mentioned** and that matches one of the definitions (A‑E).  
3. **If the excerpt mentions a method that does not fit any of A‑E, select Y (Other).**  
4. **If the excerpt mentions more than one applicable method, select **all** corresponding letters** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
5. **If the excerpt provides no information about the tuning method, select only Z.**  
6. **Do not infer, guess, or add information that is not directly stated** in the excerpt.  
7. **Do not provide any explanation, commentary, or additional text**—only the final list of letters (or a single letter) in the exact format shown below.  

**Output Format**  

- A comma‑free, uppercase list of letters, sorted in alphabetical order if more than one (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If only one letter applies, output that single letter (e.g., `B`).  

**Reasoning (optional, for internal use only)**  
You may briefly note which sentence(s) in the excerpt support each chosen letter, but **do not include this reasoning in the final answer**.

**Example**  

```
Excerpt: “We performed a random search over learning‑rate and dropout values.”  
Answer: B

<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify the excerpt from a research paper according to the predefined coding scheme for *Nested data structure*.

**Context:**  
You will be given a single excerpt (the *Excerpt*). Use only the information explicitly stated in that excerpt.

**Instructions (follow exactly):**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Choose the single option that best matches the description of the data used for *model training* (ignore any information that only refers to validation or test data).**  
3. **If the excerpt does not contain any information about a nested data structure for the training sample, respond with the letter **`Z`**.**  
4. **Do not infer, guess, or add information that is not directly mentioned.**  
5. **If the authors explicitly state that no nesting exists, choose option 0.**  
6. **If the authors describe a hierarchical arrangement (e.g., “patients nested within clinics”), choose option 1.**  
7. **If the authors describe repeated‑measure or longitudinal data where each row is a time‑point nested within a subject (long format), choose option 2.**  
8. **If the excerpt suggests a nested structure only by implication (e.g., the sample description hints at nesting but the authors never mention it), **do not** select an option; instead answer **`Z`**.**  
9. **When multiple nesting types are described, select the option that most directly matches the primary training data structure described.**  

**Output format:**  
Return **only** the selected answer (the digit `0`, `1`, `2`, or the letter `Z`) on a single line. No explanations, no additional text, no punctuation.

**Answer Options:**  
- `0` – No nested structure.  
- `1` – Hierarchical (e.g., patients nested in clinics).

(Chekroud and Koutsouleris, 2018). The variables collected and delivery 
of interventions within these service locations are standardised across 
England (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2023). The

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt taken from a research paper and indicate which coding‑option(s) from the list below correctly describe how the authors handle **class imbalance**.  

**Output Requirement**  
Return **only** the letter(s) that apply, separated by commas (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If more than one option is valid, list all applicable letters in any order.  
- If the excerpt does not contain any information about class‑imbalance handling, output **`Z`**.  
- **Never** add explanations, comments, or any characters other than the requested letters and commas.

**Coding Scheme**  

| Letter | Meaning (must match the excerpt exactly) |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| **A** | “Up‑sampling / down‑sampling / SMOTE / other sampling on **full data**” |
| **B** | “Up‑sampling / down‑sampling / SMOTE / other sampling **after the train‑test split**” |
| **C** | “Adapting decision rules – e.g., training for sensitivity or changing the 0.50 decision cutoff” |
| **Z** | “The paper does **not** report any class‑imbalance handling” |
| **Other** (if needed) | If the excerpt clearly states a valid class‑imbalance strategy that is **not** captured by A, B, or C, select the letter **`Other`** (write it exactly as `Other`). |

**Procedural Rules**  

1. **Strict Source Adherence** – Base your decision **only** on the text provided in the excerpt. Do not infer, assume, or use external knowledge.  
2. **Exact Matching** – Choose a letter only when the excerpt explicitly mentions the corresponding method. Synonyms or vague descriptions that do not clearly map to A, B, or C should be treated as “not reported” (Z).  
3. **Multiple Valid Options** – If the excerpt mentions two or more distinct methods that belong to different letters, output all applicable letters (e.g., `A,B`).  
4. **Missing or Ambiguous Information** –  
   - If the excerpt mentions class‑imbalance handling but the description is ambiguous and cannot be definitively assigned to A, B, or C, output `Other`.  
   - If the excerpt contains **no** mention of class‑imbalance handling, output `Z`.  
5. **No Guessing** – Do not select a letter unless the excerpt provides clear evidence.  

**Example Formatting**  

- Single correct option: `A`  
- Multiple correct options: `A,B`  
- No information present: `Z`  
- Unlisted but clearly described method: `Other`

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with extracting the *Sampling method applied* from a given excerpt of a research paper. Your response must consist **only** of the letter(s) that correspond to the correct answer(s) from the list below, formatted exactly as described.

---

### 1. Coding Scheme (Answer Options)

| Letter | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **A** | Up |
| **B** | Down |
| **C** | SMOTE |
| **Y** | Other (any sampling method mentioned that is **not** Up, Down, or SMOTE) |
| **Z** | None of the above – the excerpt contains **no information** about the sampling method |

---

### 2. Extraction Rules  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Identify any explicit mention of a sampling method.  
2. **Match the mention to the coding scheme:**  
   - If the excerpt states **“Up”**, select **A**.  
   - If it states **“Down”**, select **B**.  
   - If it states **“SMOTE”**, select **C**.  
   - If it mentions any other sampling technique (e.g., “random oversampling”, “stratified sampling”, etc.), select **Y**.  
3. **Multiple methods:** If the excerpt lists *more than one* distinct sampling method, return **all applicable letters** separated by commas and no spaces (e.g., `A,C`). Preserve the order **A → B → C → Y** when multiple letters are needed.  
4. **No method mentioned:** If the excerpt contains **no reference** to any sampling method, answer **Z**.  
5. **Ambiguous or contradictory statements:**  
   - If the excerpt is unclear (e.g., “we used a sampling technique”) **without naming it**, treat it as **no information** → **Z**.  
   - If the excerpt contains conflicting methods (e.g., “both Up and SMOTE were applied”), include **all** relevant letters (`A,C`).  

---

### 3. Handling Missing or Unclear Information  

- **Do not infer** a method that is not explicitly named.  
- **Do not guess** based on context outside the excerpt.  
- If the excerpt mentions a method but the spelling or case differs (e.g., “up‑sampling”, “SMOTE‑based”), still map it to the appropriate letter (A, B, C, or Y) as long as the meaning is clear.  

---

### 4. Output Format  

- **Only** the letter(s) described above.  
- If multiple letters are required, separate them with a **single comma** and **no spaces** (e.g., `A,C,Y`).  
- If a single letter applies, output that single character (e.g., `B`).  
- **Never** include explanations, headings, or any additional text.

---

### 5. Reasoning (optional, for internal use)  

You may briefly verify the mapping internally before responding, but **do not** output any of that reasoning.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. From a given excerpt of a research paper you must identify which of the predefined comparison categories (A‑E) are **explicitly** mentioned. Return **only** the corresponding letter(s) in the format described below. Do **not** add explanations, comments, or any text that is not a letter code.

---

### 1. Source Material  
- **Excerpt:** `{context}` (the exact text you will analyze)  
- **Target variable:** *Model comparisons* – focus only on comparisons of predictive performance between models. Comparisons that are based solely on variable importance, feature selection, or any non‑predictive‑performance criteria must be ignored.

---

### 2. Answer Options (letter → definition)  

| Letter | Definition (must be stated **exactly** in the excerpt) |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | Comparison between a naïve guessing model (e.g., always predicts the majority class, random guessing, or a simple rule) and **any** machine‑learning (ML) model. |
| **B** | Comparison between an **unregularized** linear/logistic‑regression model and a **regularized** linear/logistic‑regression model **or** a more complex ML model. |
| **C** | Comparison **among** simple regularized linear/logistic models (Ridge, LASSO, Elastic‑Net). |
| **D** | Comparison between a **simple** regularized linear/logistic model **and** a **complex** ML model (any algorithm listed in section 3.1 of the source). |
| **E** | Comparison **among** different complex ML models. |
| **O** *(Other)* | The excerpt states a model‑comparison that is **clearly correct** but does **not** match any of the definitions A‑E. |
| **Z** | No information about any of the above comparisons is present in the excerpt. |

*Only the letters listed above may be output.*

---

### 3. Extraction Rules  

1. **Exact match required** – a category is selected **only** if the excerpt contains language that unambiguously satisfies the definition of that letter.  
2. **Multiple categories** – if more than one definition is satisfied, list **all** applicable letters.  
3. **Other (O)** – if the excerpt describes a valid model‑comparison that does not fit A‑E, add **O** to the output.  
4. **None (Z)** – if the excerpt contains **no** statement that matches any of A‑E or O, output only **Z**.  
5. **No inference** – do *not* infer or guess a comparison that is not explicitly stated.  
6. **No partial credit** – if a statement is ambiguous (e.g., “some models performed better”) and does not specify the type of comparison required, treat it as absent and do not select any letter for it.  

---

### 4. Output Format  

- **Single line** containing only the selected letter(s).  
- If more than one letter is needed, separate them with **commas, no spaces**, ordered alphabetically (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If only one letter applies, output just that letter (e.g., `D`).  
- **Never** include any additional words, punctuation (other than commas), or whitespace.

---

### 5. Optional Reasoning (internal)  

You may briefly reason internally to decide which letters apply, but **do not** include that reasoning in the final answer.

# Examples:
Example: &quot;Thirteen machine learning algorithms were selected to provide a 
broad comparison (of a variety of modelling techniques) and to be 
consistent with research that has used similar methods (Webb et al., 
2020). To provide a benchmark against the machine learning models, an 
ordinary least squares regression (OLS) model with all the available 
same predictors (in the same manner as the machine learning models) 
was included. The multiple OLS acts as a comparator with penalised 
regression models by fitting the data without any regularisation, making 
it prone to overfitting compared to models with regularisation. Addi
tionally, two other comparison models akin to those used in similar 
research were fitted (Buckman et al., 2021a). The first was an OLS 
regression model with only the pre-treatment GAD-7 score included, as 
initial symptom severity is one of the most important factors considered 
by clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes (and allocating treat
ment) for their patients (Amati et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2021b; 
O’Driscoll et al., 2021). Separately, a null model was created using the 
mean post-treatment GAD-7 score in the training and validation dataset 
as the prediction for all test dataset cases. Five models based upon elastic 
net regularised regression (ENR; Friedman et al., 2010) were included 
(alpha parameters were 0.0; full ridge, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0; full 
lasso), using the ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection oper
ator (lasso) penalisations to reduce overfitting. Two spline regression 
models were used: adaptive splines (Friedman, 1991) and adaptive 
polynomial splines (Stone et al., 1997). In addition, two 
decision-tree-based algorithms were used: random forest (Breiman, 
2001) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., 
2010). Lastly, three support vector machines (SVM) were included with 
linear, polynomial and radial kernels (Dimitriadou et al., 2009). Full 
details of the models are presented in Supplementary Material 1 
(Table 3). 
SuperLearner (van der Laan et al., 2007), the chosen ensemble 
modelling tool, uses cross-validation to estimate the predictive perfor
mance of individual machine learning algorithms, and ultimately de
termines the most accurate model within the ensemble.&quot; (Section 2.4; p.2)
 True Answer: [&#x27;Y&#x27;]

 role occupancy to compare the predictive performance of traditional

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with extracting a single piece of information from a supplied excerpt of a research paper. The extraction must follow the coding rules below **exactly** and must not include any additional commentary, explanation, or invented text.

---

### 1. Target Variable  
**Best‑performing model (in the context of the authors’ comparison).**

### 2. Extraction Rules  

| Situation | What to output |
|-----------|----------------|
| **The excerpt names one specific algorithm/model as the best** | Output **exactly the name or phrase** used by the authors (copy‑paste, preserving spelling and capitalization). |
| **The authors state that more than one algorithm/model is best (i.e., no single algorithm outperforms the others)** | Output the code **`1`**. |
| **The authors claim an algorithm is best **but the reported performance numbers contradict this claim** (i.e., another algorithm clearly has higher scores)** | Output the code **`99`** **and** include a brief comment in parentheses stating *“contradicts reported metrics”*. Example: `99 (contradicts reported metrics)`. |
| **The excerpt does not contain any information about which model is best** | Output **`Z`**. |
| **The excerpt is ambiguous (e.g., it mentions “the top model” without naming it, or the wording could refer to different models)** | Treat this as “information not present” and output **`Z`**. |

*Do not guess, infer, or re‑phrase the information.*  
*Only use text that appears **exactly** in the excerpt (except for the coded values `1`, `99`, `Z`).*

# Examples:
Example: &quot;The mean of the post-treatment GAD-7 scores in the validation 
sample was 7.4 (±5.2) and 37.1 % individuals were in caseness at the 
end of treatment (their GAD-7 score was ≥8). Through training the 
ensemble using 10-fold internal cross-validation within the training 
sample (repeated ten times), the BART algorithm produced the lowest 
prediction error when generalising to the validation dataset (MSE [95 % 
CI]=16.72 [16.12; 17.32]; MAE=3.16; R2  =0.38; see Table 2). The BART 
model also had the combined lowest prediction error in terms of the 
secondary outcome metric (MAE) along with the adaptive polynomial 
spline model. Both models’ MAE indicated that on average the predicted 
post-treatment GAD-7 scores differed from the true values by 3.16 
points. The linear regression model (with all predictors) had the greatest 
R but was more error prone to error, with higher MSE and MAE values. 
As MSE was the primary evaluation metric, the BART model was 
determined to be the winning model within the ensemble.&quot; (Section 3.1; p.3)

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
Classify the model‑validation approach described in a research‑paper excerpt according to the coding scheme below.

**Context**  
You will be given a single excerpt (the *Excerpt*). All decisions must be based **only** on the information explicitly present in that excerpt. Do not use any external knowledge, infer unstated details, or add commentary.

**Coding Scheme**  

| Letter | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | No validation – performance is reported only on the training data. |
| **B** | Internal, no split – performance is assessed by cross‑validation within the training set; no independent hold‑out set. |
| **C** | Internal, single split – one train‑test split (e.g., 80/20) is used. |
| **D** | Internal, repeated splits – multiple train‑test splits or nested resampling (&gt;1 outer iteration). |
| **E** | External, same population – validation on an independent data set drawn from the same population as the training data. |
| **F** | External, different population – validation on an independent data set from a different population. |
| **O** | **Other** – the excerpt clearly indicates a validation method that does **not** match any of the letters A‑F. |
| **Z** | Not reported – the excerpt contains no information about model validation. |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Identify every validation approach that is *explicitly* described.  
2. **Select all applicable letters** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If the excerpt mentions more than one distinct approach, list every corresponding letter.  
   - If the described approach matches none of A‑F, return the single letter **O**.  
3. **If the excerpt provides no validation information at all**, return **Z**.  
4. **Do not guess, infer, or extrapolate** beyond what is written.  
5. **Do not provide explanations, rationales, or any additional text**—only the final list of letters (or a single letter).  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- **Ambiguous wording**: If the wording could be interpreted as more than one category, choose the *most specific* category that is unambiguously supported. If ambiguity remains, treat the information as not reported and answer **Z**.  
- **Partial information**: If the excerpt mentions only part of a validation procedure (e.g., “we used cross‑validation”) without specifying split type, select the letter that matches the stated part (e.g., **B**).  
- **Multiple validation stages**: If both internal and external validation are described, include letters for each stage (e.g., `B,F`).  

**Output Format**  

- A comma‑separated list of capital letters with **no spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If only one letter applies, output that single letter (e.g., `Z`).  

**Example**  

```
Excerpt: “The model was trained on the 2018 cohort and then tested on the 2019 cohort, which includes participants from a different country.”
Answer: F

 Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: &quot;Applying these two steps (i.e., cross-validation and a test set), we first removed a random 1/3 of our data as a test set. This test data contained 1,127 observations, of which 129 (11.4%) occupied a leadership role. We used the remaining 2/3 of the observations as model development data. This set of 2,258 observations contained 238 (10.5%) individuals in a leadership position. We used these data for repeated cross-validation. In our cross-validation procedure, we randomly split these 2,258 observations into ten approximately equal parts, and iteratively used nine as training data and the remaining one as validation data until all parts had functioned as validation data once. We repeated this procedure ten times to decrease the influence of chance. Finally, the performance of the RF and LM was evaluated on the test set.&quot; (Section &quot;RQ1&quot; ; p. 4)

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. From the excerpt provided, you must determine how the authors handled **data‑preparation steps for the training set versus the test set** and code the answer according to the scheme below.

---

### 1. What you must decide  

- **Jointly** – the same preparation step(s) were applied to *both* the training and test data at the same time.  
- **Separately** – the preparation step(s) were applied to the training data **and** to the test data **independently** (i.e., the test data were never used to influence the training‑set processing).  

If the excerpt does not mention any data‑preparation step for the training or test set, or if it is impossible to tell from the text, you must indicate that the information is **not reported**.

If the study does **not** use a validation split (e.g., “no validation”, “internal study, no split”), the variable is **not applicable**.

---

### 2. Coding scheme (choose **exactly one**)

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **0** | Not reported – the excerpt gives no information about whether preparation was joint or separate. |
| **1** | Jointly – it is explicitly stated that a preparation step was performed *jointly* on training + test data. |
| **2** | Separately – it is explicitly stated that preparation steps were performed *separately* on training and test data. |
| **-99** | Not applicable – the study has “no validation” or “internal, no split” as described in section 4.2. |

*Important:* **Only** code **1** when the document **clearly** says the step was performed jointly. Do **not** infer joint processing from the order in which methods are described or from any chronological narrative.

---

### 3. Handling special cases  

- **Missing information** – If the excerpt provides no mention of training‑test preparation, return **0**.  
- **Ambiguous or contradictory statements** – If you cannot determine a single, unambiguous answer, also return **0**.  
- **No validation / no split** – If the excerpt contains a phrase such as “no validation”, “internal study, no split”, or any equivalent wording indicating that a test set was never created, return **-99**.  
- **Multiple preparation steps** – If some steps are joint *and* others are separate, follow the rule in the original description: code as **1 (Jointly)** **only** when it is *clearly* stated that a step was performed jointly. Otherwise, treat the overall variable as **0 (Not reported)** because the information is mixed/unclear.

---

### 4. Output format  

- Return **only the numeric code** (0, 1, 2, or -99).  
- Do **not** include any explanation, label, or additional characters.  
- Example of a correct response: `2`

---

### 5. Reasoning (optional, for internal use only)  

You may briefly note to yourself why you chose a particular code, but **do not** output that reasoning. It is only for your internal verification.

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the numeric value for a specific variable from a supplied research‑paper excerpt.

**Context Structure**  
- **Target Variable:** *Train‑test split ratio*  
- **Description:** The percentage of the data assigned to the training set in the internal split.  

**Instructions**  
1. **Read the excerpt** (provided in the placeholder `{context}`) carefully.  
2. **Locate the exact numeric value** that expresses the train‑test split ratio (e.g., “70% train / 30% test”, “train‑test split = 0.75”, etc.).  
3. **Output ONLY** the numeric value **as it appears** in the document (retain the same format: decimal, fraction, or percentage number).  
4. If the excerpt **does not contain** a train‑test split ratio, or the value is ambiguous/unreadable, output the single character **`Z`**.  
5. **Do not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or infer a value.  
   - Convert units (e.g., from percent to decimal).  
   - Add any explanation, units, symbols, or additional text.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  
- If multiple numbers are present, choose the one **explicitly linked** to the train‑test split ratio.  
- If the value is expressed as a range (e.g., “70–80% train”), treat it as ambiguous and return **`Z`**.  
- If the value is described qualitatively (“the majority of data was used for training”), return **`Z`**.  

**Output Format**  
```
Answer: &lt;numeric value or Z&gt;
```
Replace `&lt;numeric value or Z&gt;` with the extracted number or the character `Z` only.

In our cross-validation procedure, we randomly split these 2,258 observations into ten approximately equal parts, and iteratively used nine as training data and the remaining one as validation data until all parts had functioned as validation data once.

{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. From the supplied excerpt, you must assign **exactly one code** that best represents how the authors treat model comparison, according to the coding scheme below.

**Output Requirement**  
- Return **only the code** (e.g., `1`, `2`, `Z`, or `-99`).  
- No additional words, symbols, explanations, or whitespace are allowed.

**Coding Scheme**  

| Code | Meaning (must be supported by the excerpt) |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| **1** | **Descriptive comparison** – the authors mention or show model performance differences **without providing an explanatory interpretation** (e.g., “Random forest achieved 85 % accuracy, elastic net 78 %”). |
| **2** | **Interpretative comparison** – the authors **draw a conclusion or hypothesis** about why one model outperforms another or what the comparison reveals about the data (e.g., “The superior performance of the random forest suggests the presence of interaction effects”). |
| **Z** | The excerpt **contains no information** about model comparison (no mention of multiple models, performance metrics, or any comparison). |
| **-99** | The target variable is **not applicable** because the prerequisite condition “0 in 4.1” is true. *(If you do not have that prerequisite information, ignore this code and follow the other rules.)* |

**Decision Procedure**  

1. **Search the excerpt** for any reference to **two or more predictive models** (e.g., random forest, elastic net, SVM, etc.) and any **performance metric** or result that links them.  
2. **Classify the nature of the comparison**:  
   - If the text only **reports numbers or statements** about which model performed better **without explaining why**, select **1**.  
   - If the text **provides an explanation, hypothesis, or inference** about the reason for the performance difference or what it implies about the data, select **2**.  
3. **If both types appear**, the interpretative element supersedes the descriptive one; choose **2**.  
4. **If no model‑comparison content is found**, output **Z**.  
5. **If you know that “0 in 4.1” applies**, output **-99** regardless of the excerpt content.  

**Handling Ambiguity &amp; Missing Information**  

- **Do not infer** missing details. If the excerpt is vague (e.g., “Model A performed better”) and provides no explanatory reason, treat it as **descriptive** (code 1).  
- If the excerpt mentions only a single model or only general performance without a comparative reference, treat it as **no comparison** (code Z).  
- If the excerpt contains contradictory statements, prioritize the **most explicit** statement present.  

**Optional Reasoning (for your internal use only)**  
You may silently note why you chose a particular code to improve accuracy, but **do not include that reasoning in the final answer**.

# Examples:
Example: &quot;The mean of the post-treatment GAD-7 scores in the validation 
sample was 7.4 (±5.2) and 37.1 % individuals were in caseness at the 
end of treatment (their GAD-7 score was ≥8). Through training the 
ensemble using 10-fold internal cross-validation within the training 
sample (repeated ten times), the BART algorithm produced the lowest 
prediction error when generalising to the validation dataset (MSE [95 % 
CI]=16.72 [16.12; 17.32]; MAE=3.16; R2  =0.38; see Table 2). The BART 
model also had the combined lowest prediction error in terms of the 
secondary outcome metric (MAE) along with the adaptive polynomial 
spline model. Both models’ MAE indicated that on average the predicted 
post-treatment GAD-7 scores differed from the true values by 3.16 
points. The linear regression model (with all predictors) had the greatest 
R but was more error prone to error, with higher MSE and MAE values. 
As MSE was the primary evaluation metric, the BART model was 
determined to be the winning model within the ensemble.&quot; (Section 3.1; p.3)
 True Answer: [&#x27;Y&#x27;]
 Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: &quot;Answering our first research question, focusing on the degree to which non-linear effects and interactions help explain the trait‑leadership role occupancy relationship, we compared the predictive performance of a linear model (LM) with the predictive performance of a random forest (RF) model. While comparing the two models, we offered more flexibility to the RF to fit complexity beyond linear additive effects. Our results suggested that the RF outperformed the LM in the cross-validation step and indicated that the RF had some advantage in predicting leadership role occupancy in the test set. These results suggest that modeling complexity beyond linear and additive effects of traits has some added value in predicting leadership role occupancy (RQ 1), supporting the interactionist accounts of the leader-trait paradigm.&quot; (Section &quot;Discussion; p.9)

<td><pre>**Task**  
Classify the programming language used for the machine‑learning computations in a research paper excerpt.

**Context**  
You will be given a single excerpt from a research article (the *Excerpt*). Use only the information explicitly present in that excerpt.

**Coding Scheme**  
Select **all** letters that apply, based on the excerpt:

| Letter | Programming language |
|--------|----------------------|
| A | R |
| B | Python |
| C | Julia |
| D | Matlab |
| E | Stata |
| F | SPSS |
| G | SAS |
| Y | Other (the correct language is mentioned but is not listed above) |
| Z | No information about the programming language is present in the excerpt |

**Special rule** – If the authors do **not** name a programming language but name a software package that is *exclusively* tied to a single language (e.g., “tidyverse”, “caret”, “lme4” → R; “scikit‑learn”, “pandas” → Python; “DataFrames.jl” → Julia; “Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox” → Matlab; “StataCorp” → Stata; “SPSS Statistics” → SPSS; “SAS/STAT” → SAS), infer that language and select its corresponding letter.

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify every programming language** that is either (a) directly named, or (b) uniquely implied by a package name as described above.  
3. **Select the corresponding letter(s).**  
   - If more than one language meets the criteria, list all applicable letters separated by commas (e.g., `A,B`).  
   - If the correct language is mentioned but is not among A‑G, select `Y`.  
   - If **no** language information can be found, select only `Z`.  
4. **Do not** infer, guess, or add any interpretation beyond the excerpt.  
5. **Do not** provide explanations, reasoning, or any text other than the required letter(s).  

**Output format**  
Exactly one line containing the selected letter(s) (e.g., `A`, `A,B,E`, `Y`, or `Z`). No surrounding punctuation or commentary.

**Example**  
*Excerpt:* “All analyses were performed using the caret and ggplot2 packages.”

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with coding a single piece of information from a supplied excerpt of a research paper. The coding follows a fixed scheme; only one code may be chosen for each excerpt.

---

### 1. Coding Target  
**Variable:** *Package / library / modeling framework version reported*  

**Definition:**  
- **“Yes”** – The authors **explicitly** list the exact version number(s) of any machine‑learning‑related software (e.g., “scikit‑learn 1.2.2”, “caret 6.0‑93”, “mlr3 0.15.0”).  
- **“No”** – No version numbers are mentioned.  
- **“Z”** – The excerpt does not contain any information about software packages, libraries, or modeling frameworks (i.e., the target is completely absent).

---

### 2. Answer Options (choose **exactly one**)  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **1** | No – the excerpt discusses software but does **not** provide version numbers. |
| **2** | Yes – the excerpt **explicitly** reports version numbers of ML‑related packages, libraries, or meta‑modeling frameworks. |
| **Z** | Not applicable – the excerpt contains **no** reference to any package, library, or modeling framework at all. |

---

### 3. Instructions (strictly followed)

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text appearing after `Excerpt:`) **carefully**.  
2. **Identify** whether the excerpt mentions any ML‑related package, library, or modeling framework **and** whether a **specific version number** is provided.  
3. **Select the single appropriate code** from the table above:
   - If a version number is present → **2**.  
   - If the software is mentioned **without** a version → **1**.  
   - If there is **no mention** of software at all → **Z**.  
4. **Do not infer** missing information, extrapolate from other sections, or use external knowledge.  
5. **Do not provide any explanation, justification, or additional text**—output **only** the chosen code (e.g., `2`).  
6. **Edge‑case handling**:  
   - If multiple packages are listed and **any one** includes an explicit version, the correct code is **2**.  
   - If the excerpt contains ambiguous phrasing such as “using the latest version” or “version X.Y.Z (unspecified)”, treat this as **no explicit version** → **1**.  
   - If the excerpt is empty or consists solely of non‑technical filler, answer **Z**.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign a single code that best describes the accessibility of the data reported in that excerpt, according to the coding scheme below.

**Input Provided**  
- **Excerpt:** `{context}` (the text you must analyze)  
- **Target Variable:** *Open data*  

**Output Requirement**  
- Return **exactly one character**: either the numeric code (0‑4) that matches the excerpt **or** the letter **Z** if the excerpt provides no information about data availability.  
- **Do not** include any additional text, explanations, symbols, or whitespace.  

**Coding Scheme**  

| Code | Meaning (must match the excerpt *exactly*) |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| **0** | *Not available* – The excerpt mentions no data, states the data are unavailable, or gives no access details (e.g., private repository, broken link). |
| **1** | *Available upon request* – The excerpt says the data can be obtained only by contacting the authors. |
| **2** | *Synthetic data only* – The excerpt indicates that only simulated or synthetic data are provided; no real/original data are shared. |
| **3** | *Public repository (restricted or open)* – The excerpt notes that the data are deposited in a public repository, even if access requires registration, an agreement, or similar restrictions. |
| **4** | *Fully open access* – The excerpt states that the data are freely downloadable (e.g., supplemental files or a direct repository link) with **no** restrictions. |
| **Z** | *No information* – The excerpt does not mention data availability at all. |

**Step‑by‑Step Procedure**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify any statement about data availability** (e.g., “data are available…”, “can be obtained by contacting…”, “synthetic data only”, “deposited in…”, “downloadable at…”).  
3. **Match the identified statement to the most specific code** in the table above.  
   - If multiple statements appear, choose the code that reflects the *most permissive* access described (e.g., if both “available upon request” and “deposited in a public repository” are mentioned, select **3**).  
4. **If the excerpt contains no mention of data at all**, output **Z**.  
5. **If the excerpt is ambiguous or contradictory**, apply the following hierarchy to resolve it (higher number = more permissive): 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4. Choose the highest‑ranking code that can be justified.  
6. **Output only the selected code** (0‑4 or Z) with no trailing newline or spaces.

**Important Rules**  

- **Do not infer** information that is not explicitly stated.  
- **Do not guess** or provide any rationale.  
- **Do not add** any characters other than the single required output.  

**Example**  

```
Excerpt: &quot;All raw sequencing files are deposited in the NCBI SRA under accession XYZ and are freely downloadable.&quot;

Excerpt:

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign a single code that indicates whether the study was *preregistered* according to the excerpt.

**Coding Scheme (choose **exactly one** option)**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **1** | The excerpt states **explicitly** that the study was *not* preregistered, or it provides a clear statement that no preregistration was performed. |
| **2** | The excerpt states **explicitly** that the study *was* preregistered (e.g., mentions a registration number, a registry, a protocol, or any definitive confirmation of preregistration). |
| **Z** | The excerpt contains **no information** about preregistration – the topic is not mentioned, the statement is ambiguous, or the excerpt is silent on the matter. |

**Instructions – Follow These Steps Rigorously**

1. **Read the entire excerpt** (the text that replaces `{context}`) carefully.  
2. **Search for any explicit statement** about preregistration:
   - Look for phrases such as “preregistered”, “registered”, “pre‑registered”, “protocol was deposited”, “registered on ClinicalTrials.gov”, “OSF registration #…”, etc.
   - A statement that the study was *not* preregistered (e.g., “the study was not preregistered”, “no preregistration was performed”) qualifies for code **1**.
3. **If an explicit confirmation of preregistration is found**, assign code **2**.  
4. **If the excerpt does not mention preregistration at all**, or the mention is vague/uncertain (e.g., “we considered preregistration”, “preregistration may have been done”, “the protocol was prepared”), assign code **Z**. Do **not** infer or guess based on external knowledge.  
5. **If contradictory statements appear** (both “preregistered” and “not preregistered”), prioritize the **most explicit** claim. If they are truly ambiguous, default to **Z**.  
6. **Output** **only** the single code (`1`, `2`, or `Z`). **No additional text, explanations, or formatting** is allowed.

**Optional Reasoning (for internal verification only – do **not** include it in the final answer)**  
- After deciding on a code, you may briefly note to yourself which exact sentence led to the decision. This reasoning should stay private and must not appear in the response.

**Example**  

```
Excerpt:
&quot;The trial was preregistered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01234567) before data collection began.&quot;

Answer:
2
```

**Now apply the above procedure to the following excerpt:**

4. **Missing or ambiguous information:**  
   - If the excerpt does **not** contain a clear, exact numeric value for the required sample size, output the single character `Z`.  
   - Do not treat ranges (“≈1000”, “between 800 and 900”), estimates (“about 500”), or vague statements (“a large sample”) as valid values; answer `Z` in such cases.  
5. **Do not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or infer values that are not explicitly stated.  
   - Include units, symbols, words, or any explanatory text.  
   - Return anything other than the integer(s) or `Z`.  

**Note:** You may perform internal reasoning to ensure correctness, but **the final output must contain only the number(s) or `Z`** as specified.

**Context Structure**  
- **Target Variable:** *Number of predictor variables used in the final analysis*  
- **Excerpt:** `{context}`  

**Instructions**

1. **Locate the value** – Scan the excerpt for the exact number of predictor variables that were *actually used* in the final statistical model (e.g., regression, machine‑learning, multivariate analysis).  
2. **Strict source compliance** – The answer must be taken **verbatim** from the text. Do **not** perform any calculation, rounding, conversion, or inference.  
3. **Missing or ambiguous information** –  
   - If the excerpt does **not** state the number of predictor variables, or the statement is vague (e.g., “several predictors”, “a handful”, “more than ten”) and no precise integer can be read, output **`Z`**.  
   - If multiple numbers appear, choose the one that explicitly refers to the *final* set of predictors. If none can be unambiguously linked, output **`Z`**.  
4. **Output format** – Respond **only** with the extracted integer (e.g., `12`) or the single character `Z`.  
   - **Do not** include units, commas, extra spaces, explanations, or any other text.  

**Reasoning (optional, for internal use only):**  
- Identify sentences describing the final model.  
- Verify that the number mentioned is the count of predictors, not participants, outcomes, or other quantities.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a supplied excerpt from a research paper and determine the **Country (or countries) where the data were collected**. You must then encode this information using the predefined coding scheme below.

---

### 1. Source‑only Requirement  
- **Base every decision exclusively on the information that appears in the excerpt.**  
- Do **not** infer, guess, or add any knowledge that is not explicitly stated.  
- Do **not** provide explanations, comments, or any text other than the final answer.

### 2. Mapping the Country  
| Letter | Country (or grouping) |
|--------|-----------------------|
| **A** | Cross‑cultural (specific countries not listed) |
| **B** | USA |
| **C** | UK |
| **D** | Germany |
| **E** | Australia |
| **F** | Canada |
| **G** | China |
| **H** | Netherlands |
| **I** | France |
| **J** | Italy |
| **K** | Brazil |
| **L** | Spain |
| **M** | Japan |
| **N** | Turkey |
| **O** | South Korea |
| **P** | Sweden |
| **Q** | Switzerland |
| **R** | Israel |
| **S** | Norway |
| **Y** | **Other** (any country not listed, or a region/continent that cannot be mapped to a specific listed country) |
| **Z** | Not reported (no country, city, state, region, or any geographic cue is present) |

### 3. How to Choose the Letter(s)

1. **Exact country name** – If the excerpt names a country that appears in the table, output the corresponding letter.  
2. **City/State/Region → Country** – If only a city, state, province, or region is mentioned, map it to its country **provided the mapping is unambiguous** (e.g., “Toronto” → Canada). Use the appropriate letter.  
3. **Multiple countries** – If the excerpt clearly indicates data from more than one distinct country, list **all applicable letters** separated by commas, in **alphabetical order** (e.g., `B,D,G`).  
4. **Cross‑cultural design** – If the study explicitly states it is “cross‑cultural” or “multinational” **without listing the specific countries**, output **A**.  
5. **Other country** – If the country is mentioned but it is **not** in the table (e.g., “India”), output **Y**.  
6. **Only a continent/region** – If the excerpt refers only to a continent or a vague region (e.g., “Europe”, “Southeast Asia”) and no specific country can be derived, output **Y**.  
7. **Ambiguous city/region** – If a place name could belong to more than one country (e.g., “Springfield”) and the excerpt does not clarify which one, treat this as **Z** (Not reported).  
8. **No geographic information** – If the excerpt contains no reference to a country, city, state, or region, output **Z**.  

### 4. Output Format  

- Return **only** the letter(s) described above.  
- When multiple letters are required, separate them with a **single comma** and **no spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If a single letter is needed, return it alone (e.g., `B`).  

### 5. Optional Reasoning (Do Not Include in Output)  

If you wish to improve accuracy, you may internally follow this checklist before producing the final answer:  

1. Scan the excerpt for any country name → map to letter.  
2. If none, scan for city/state/region → map unambiguously to a country.  
3. If still none, check for “cross‑cultural” wording.  
4. If still none, check for any non‑listed country or vague region → Y.  
5. If nothing at all → Z.  

**Do not** output this reasoning; it is for internal use only.

Excerpt:
{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are a research assistant who must code each excerpt according to a fixed taxonomy of predictor‑variable data types. Follow the steps exactly and output **only** the required letters (or “Z”)—no explanations, no extra text.

---

### Procedure  

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text that follows the label **“Excerpt:”**).  
2. **Identify every data type that is explicitly mentioned** in the excerpt.  
   - A data type matches only when the passage unambiguously describes it; do **not** infer from context or from outside knowledge.  
3. **Select the corresponding letter(s)** from the list below:  
   - List **all applicable letters** in **alphabetical order**, separated by commas **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If the excerpt states a data type **not listed** among the options, also select the letter **`O`** (designated for “Other”).  
   - If **no information** about any listed data type is present, answer **`Z`**.  
4. **Do not provide any additional text** (no reasoning, no commentary). The final answer must be exactly the letter(s) or `Z`.

---

### Handling Ambiguity &amp; Missing Information  

- **Ambiguous statements** (e.g., “some physiological measure” without a clear definition) are treated as **not present**; do not select a letter.  
- **Partial mentions** that do not match any definition verbatim are also considered **absent**.  
- If a single sentence could belong to more than one category but is not **clearly** defined, **do not** select any letter for that sentence.  

---

### Answer Options (letter → definition)  

- **A:** Behavioral observation data – systematic recordings or codings of observable actions or interactions (e.g., classroom participation, gaze behavior, social engagement).  
- **B:** Performance data – outcomes from task‑based assessments (e.g., IQ scores, reaction time, cognitive‑task results).  
- **C:** Digital trace data – automatically logged behavioral data from digital devices or platforms (e.g., screen time, app usage, GPS location, typing dynamics).  
- **D:** Higher‑dimensional data from text / image / audio – features extracted from unstructured modalities such as natural language, visual input, or sound (e.g., text embeddings, pixel‑based image features, audio spectrograms).  
- **E:** Biophysical measures – quantitative measurements of biological or physiological structures or functions (e.g., genetic markers, hormone levels, heart‑rate variability).  
- **F:** Rating / judgement data – structured evaluations based on rating scales or subjective judgments (e.g., Likert‑scale responses, observer ratings).  
- **G:** Demographic / biographical data – factual records about an individual’s life circumstances or traits (e.g., age, marital status, education, medical diagnoses).  
- **H:** Contextual / aggregate data – features of the broader environment or context (e.g., regional average income, school‑level teacher‑student ratios, therapist gender).  
- **O:** Other – the excerpt explicitly mentions a data type that does **not** fit any of A‑H.

# Examples:
Example: &quot;The predictors 
used in this study, that were those available to inform clinical decision 
making prior to starting treatment and were all collected routinely as 
part of the MDS at the initial assessment, are the individual items from 
the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 
2006) used to measure symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, the 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001) for 
depressive symptoms, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; 
Mundt et al., 2002) for functional impairment, and the IAPT Phobia 
Scale Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (2011) to screen for 
phobic anxiety disorders. The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 total scores were also 
included. Only items two-to-five of the WSAS were used as the first item 
is not applicable for unemployed individuals. Other predictors were: 
age, ethnicity, employment status, gender, long-term health condition 
status, and psychotropic medication prescription and usage. Local Layer 
Super Output Areas (LSOAs) were converted to Indices of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD) as a measure of local area deprivation. Finally, the 
number of weeks between referral and initial assessment, and between 
assessment and first therapy session were included.&quot; (Section 2.2; p.2)
 True Answer: [&#x27;Y&#x27;]

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Role**: You are an expert research‑assistant whose sole job is to map a research‑paper excerpt to the coding scheme below.

**Task**: From the excerpt (provided in the placeholder **{context}**) select **all** letters that **explicitly** describe the data type of the outcome variable. Follow the rules exactly; do not add any explanation, commentary, or characters beyond the required letters.

**Coding Scheme**  

| Letter | Category (definition) |
|--------|-----------------------|
| A | Behavioral observation data – systematic recordings or codings of observable actions or interactions (e.g., classroom participation, gaze behavior, social engagement). |
| B | Performance data – task‑based or ability‑driven assessments that yield quantifiable outcomes (e.g., IQ scores, reaction time, cognitive‑task results). |
| C | Digital trace data – automatically logged behavioral data from digital devices or platforms, passively collected (e.g., screen‑time, app usage, GPS location, typing dynamics). |
| D | Higher‑dimensional data from text / image / audio – features extracted from unstructured modalities (e.g., text embeddings, pixel‑based image features, audio spectrograms). |
| E | Biophysical measures – quantitative measurements of biological or physiological structures or functions (e.g., genetic markers, hormone levels, heart‑rate variability). |
| F | Rating / judgement data – structured evaluations based on rating scales or subjective judgments (e.g., Likert‑scale responses, observer ratings). |
| G | Demographic / biographical data – factual or historical records about an individual’s life circumstances or traits (e.g., age, marital status, education history, medical diagnoses). |
| H | Contextual / aggregate data – features of the broader environment or context (e.g., regional average income, school‑level teacher‑student ratios, therapist gender in multilevel data). |
| O | **Other** – the excerpt clearly indicates a data type that is **not** captured by A‑H. |
| Z | **None** – the excerpt contains no information that matches any of the categories A‑H (or is ambiguous such that no definitive category can be assigned). |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read only the excerpt** (the text inside **{context}**). Do not use any external knowledge.  
2. Identify every category that is **explicitly stated** in the excerpt. Implicit inference or guesswork is not allowed.  
3. If the excerpt mentions a data type that does **not** correspond to any of A‑H, select **O**.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt of a research paper and extract the **exact wording** that describes the study’s prediction task (the outcome being predicted).

---

### Instructions  

1. **Extract verbatim**  
   - Return the phrase that *exactly* appears in the excerpt to describe the predicted outcome (e.g., “Predicting students‑at‑risk in language acquisition”).  
   - Do **not** alter spelling, punctuation, or wording; copy the text word‑for‑word.

2. **Missing information**  
   - If the excerpt does **not** contain any phrase that describes a prediction task/outcome, answer **only** with the single character `Z`.

3. **No inference or paraphrasing**  
   - Do not guess, infer, or re‑phrase the information.  
   - Do not add explanations, comments, or any additional text.

4. **Output format**  
   - Provide a **single short phrase** (or the character `Z`) on its own line, with no surrounding labels or whitespace.

5. **Edge‑case handling**  
   - If multiple candidate phrases appear, choose the one that most directly states the prediction target (the phrase that follows “predicting…”, “prediction of…”, “forecasting…”, etc.).  
   - If the phrase is embedded within a longer sentence, extract only the core description (the part that names the outcome), still preserving the original wording.

6. **Optional reasoning (for internal use only)**  
   - You may first locate the sentence that mentions “predict”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, or similar language, then copy the exact phrase that follows.  
   - This reasoning should **not** appear in the final answer.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You will read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign it to one category of a predefined coding scheme.  

**Output Requirement**  
- Return **exactly one token**: either `1`, `2`, or the letter `Z`.  
- **Do not** include any additional characters, spaces, line‑breaks, or explanations.  

**When to use each token**  

| Token | Meaning (must match the excerpt *exactly*) |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| **1** | The outcome is already known or measured at the same time as (or before) the predictor data. Example: “predicting personality traits with music‑listening behavior.” |
| **2** | The outcome occurs **after** the predictor data were collected and is therefore unknown at that point. Example: “predicting relapse or therapy dropout using predictors gathered at the start of therapy.” |
| **Z** | The excerpt provides **no information** that allows you to determine whether the outcome is contemporaneous or future‑oriented. In other words, the required information is missing, ambiguous, or irrelevant. |

**Guidelines for Classification**  

1. **Strictly follow the excerpt** – base your decision only on the text supplied in the *Excerpt* field.  
2. **Do not infer or guess** – if the excerpt does not explicitly state the temporal relationship between predictor and outcome, choose `Z`.  
3. **Edge‑case handling**  
   - If the excerpt mentions both a contemporaneous and a future outcome, select the option that **best matches the primary outcome** described.  
   - If the excerpt is vague (e.g., “we will examine the relationship between X and Y”) and does not specify timing, answer `Z`.  
4. **No reasoning required** – you may internally reason to reach the correct token, but **do not output** that reasoning.

# Examples:
Example: &quot;The primary outcome was the GAD-7 score at the last attended therapy session.&quot; (Section 2.2; p.2)
 True Answer: [&#x27;Y&#x27;]
 Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: &quot;In our analysis, we used measures for Big Five Inventory (BFI) per
sonality traits, need for cognition (NFC), and leadership role occupancy
 (seeTable1).TheBFIpersonalitytraitsweremeasuredwiththe50-item
 Five Factor Model International Personality Item Pool (IPIP; Goldberg,
 1999) and NFC with an 18-item NFC scale (Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1984).
 The items were translated into Dutch by professional translators and
 the survey was conducted in Dutch. The internal consistency of the
 measures ranged from 0.77 to 0.90. The correlations among the BFI
 traits as well as the correlations between NFC and openness, conscien
tiousness, and neuroticism are in line with correlations found in previ
ous research (Furnham &amp; Thorne, 2013; Van der Linden, te Nijenhuis,
 &amp;Bakker,2010).Inourstudy,NFCshowsapositivecorrelationwithex
traversion and agreeableness where previous studies have respectively
 reported inconsistent and often non-significant correlations (Furnham
 &amp;Thorne,2013).ThecorrelationbetweenNFCandleadershiproleoccu
pancy, which, to thebestof our knowledge,hasnotbeendirectly tested
 before, was positive. The correlations between leadership role occu
pancyandopenness,conscientiousness,andextraversionwerepositive,
 whereas the correlations between leadership role occupancy and
 agreeableness and neuroticism were negative. Compared with meta
analyses that tested the relationship between BFI and emergence
the latter measured in part as leadership role occupancy (Barling &amp;
 Weatherhead,2016)–thecorrelationsare mostlyinthesamedirection
 exceptfor agreeableness(e.g., Ensari, Riggio, Christian, &amp; Carslaw, 2011;
 Ilies, Gerhardt, &amp; Le, 2004). In the meta-analysis of Ilies and colleagues,
 for example, agreeableness had a small overall positive correlation (r =
 0.05), whereas we find a small negative correlation (r = −0.05).
 As a measure of leadership role occupancy, we utilized the question:
 “What is your current profession/What profession did you exercise in
 your last job? (If you are retired, unemployed or currently do not have
 a job: please refer to the last job you had).” We classified individuals
 as occupying a leadership role (10.84%) when they answered the ques
tion with “higher supervisory profession (e.g. manager, director, owner
 of large company, supervisory civil servant)”.Weclassified individuals
 as not occupying a leadership role when they answered the question
 with one of the following answers: “higher academic or independent
 profession (e.g. architect, physician, scholar, academic instructor, engi
neer)” (7.71%), “intermediate academic or independent profession
 (e.g. teacher, artist, nurse, social worker, policy assistant)” (29.2%),
 “other mental work (e.g. administrative assistant, accountant, sales as
sistant, family carer)” (31.8%), “semi-skilled manual work (e.g. driver,
 factory worker)” (8.68%), “unskilled and trained manual work (e.g.
 cleaner, packer)” (9.63%), and “agrarian profession (e.g. farm worker,
 independent agriculturalist)” (2.04%).&quot; (Section &quot;Measures&quot;; p.3)

 tests linear additive effects with the predictive performance of a RF
 that allows moreflexibility. Testinghow well these engines perform re
sults in information on the complexity of the leader trait paradigm. For
 instance, if the RF outperforms the LM in terms of predictive perfor
mance, this suggests that the true leader trait relationship is likely
 more complex than linear additive effects.1 Thus, the first research

Excerpt:
{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with **classifying a single excerpt from a research paper** according to a fixed coding scheme that describes how the authors report missing data.

**Input Provided**  
- **Target Variable:** *Reporting of missingness*  
- **Answer Options:**  

| Code | Meaning (exactly as defined) |
|------|--------------------------------|
| **0** | *Not reported* – The amount of missing data is **not described at all**. |
| **1** | *General statement* – The authors give a **qualitative** description (e.g., “low missingness”) **or** a **single quantitative summary** that applies to the whole sample (e.g., “5 % missing overall”). |
| **2** | *Descriptives on variable level* – The authors **quantify missing values for each variable** (e.g., “Variable X: 3 % missing, Variable Y: 12 % missing”). |
| **Z** | *Information absent* – The excerpt provides **no information** about missing data (i.e., none of the definitions above apply). |

- **Excerpt:** `{context}` (replace with the actual text you are classifying)

**Instructions – What to Do**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Determine which single code (0, 1, 2, or Z) best matches the excerpt** according to the definitions above.  
   - If **multiple definitions appear**, select the **most specific** applicable code (the hierarchy is 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2).  
   - If the excerpt **mentions missingness only in vague, non‑quantitative terms** (e.g., “some data were missing”), choose **0** unless it qualifies as a *general statement* (code 1).  
   - If the excerpt includes **any variable‑level missing‑data counts**, choose **2**, even if a general statement is also present.  
3. **Do not infer or guess** any information that is not explicitly stated.  
4. **If the excerpt contains no mention of missing data at all**, answer **Z**.  
5. **Output Requirement:** Return **only the single code** (0, 1, 2, or Z) **with no additional text, explanation, or formatting**.  

**Optional Reasoning (for internal use only)**  
You may write a brief note for yourself (e.g., “2 – variable‑level counts given”) but **do not include it in the final answer**.  

**Example**  

- *Excerpt:* “Overall, 7 % of the dataset was missing.” → **Answer:** `1`  
- *Excerpt:* “Variable A had 2 % missing, Variable B had 15 % missing.” → **Answer:** `2`  
- *Excerpt:* “Missing data were minimal.” → **Answer:** `0`  
- *Excerpt:* “The study examined... (no mention of missing data).” → **Answer:** `Z`

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify the handling‑of‑missing‑data method(s) described in a research‑paper excerpt according to the coding scheme below.

**Instructions – follow them exactly:**

1. **Read the excerpt only** (the text between `Excerpt:` and `Answer:`). Do **not** consult any external files, code, or supplementary material unless the authors explicitly refer to those materials *within the excerpt*.

2. **Select every letter that matches a method that is **clearly stated** in the excerpt.**  
   - If the excerpt mentions a method that is **not** listed among the answer options, also select **Y (Other)**.  
   - If **more than one** method is mentioned, list all applicable letters **in alphabetical order**, separated by commas (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If **no information** about missing‑data handling is present, answer **only** `Z`.  
   - **Never** guess, infer, or add any explanation.

3. **Missing or ambiguous information:**  
   - If a statement is vague (e.g., “missing values were dealt with appropriately”) and does not specify a concrete method, treat it as **not reported** → answer `Z`.  
   - If a method is described partially but the essential technique is identifiable (e.g., “we removed cases with any missing values”), treat it as the corresponding code (here, `A`).  
   - If the excerpt refers to a supplementary file for details **without describing the method itself**, treat the method as **not reported** → answer `Z`.

4. **Output format:**  
   - Provide **only** the selected letter(s) (or `Z`) on a single line, with no surrounding text, punctuation other than commas, or whitespace.  
   - Example of a valid answer: `A,C,E` or `Z`.

**Target Variable:** Handling of missing data  

**Answer Options (choose exactly one or more letters):**  

- **A:** Listwise deletion – an observation is excluded if it has any missing values on the variables used (complete‑case analysis).  
- **B:** Threshold‑based deletion – a variable or observation is excluded when the proportion of missing data exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., &gt; 50 %).  
- **C:** Mean / median / mode imputation – missing values are replaced by a single central‑tendency statistic.  
- **D:** k‑nearest neighbors (k‑NN) imputation – missing values are imputed using the values of the *k* nearest observations.  
- **E:** Multiple imputation (specify algorithm and number of datasets *m* in a comment) – missing values are imputed multiple times to create several complete datasets.  
- **Y:** Other – any explicitly described method that does not fit A‑E.

Only if the authors explicitly refer to supplementary materials in the text for specific details on these aspects should such materials be considered. Answer Options: A: Listwise deletion - An observation is excluded from the analysis if it has any missing values on the variables included, meaning only complete cases are analyzed.
B: Threshold-based deletion - A variable or observation is excluded from the analysis if the proportion of missing data exceeded a predefined threshold (e.g., if more than 50% of its values were missing).
C: Mean / median / modus imputation - Missing values are replaced using simple rules based on central tendency. Although this is considered a single imputation method, it is coded separately.
D: k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) imputation - Missing values are imputed by identifying the k observations with the smallest distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) to the incomplete case and aggregating their values for the missing variable (e.g., using the mean, median, or majority vote).
E: Multiple imputation methods (if reported, specify algorithm and number of datasets m in comment) - Missing values are imputed multiple times to generate several complete datasets, capturing the uncertainty around the missing data (e.g., predictive mean matching (PMM) with m = 5 imputed datasets).

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a supplied excerpt from a research paper and **select every coding‑scheme letter that accurately describes the feature‑enrichment technique(s) used in that excerpt**.

**Target Variable**  
*Feature enrichment* – the use of domain knowledge to create new or more informative variables (e.g., aggregating items, computing indices, adding external data, etc.).

**Coding Scheme (choose all that apply)**  

| Letter | Definition (exact wording to match) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| **A** | *Aggregating items to scales* – “Items of the PHQ‑9 are combined into a single scale score by summing / averaging the item responses.” |
| **B** | *Clustering (grouping raw data to features)* – “Answers in a structured interview are defined as a diagnosis based on DSM‑5 criteria.” |
| **C** | *Calculation of indices* – “Deriving common indices, such as BMI, using standardized formulas from variables like weight and height.” |
| **D** | *Pre‑specifying relations between predictors* – “Interactions or quadratic terms of predictors are computed.” |
| **E** | *Computing latent trait scores* – “A score is computed for items of an underlying latent construct based on observed data, such as factor scores or Item Response Theory (IRT) scores.” |
| **F** | *Enrichment via external data sources* – “Integrating relevant external data to provide additional context or meaningful information (e.g., adding location data of cafés, gyms, and libraries to individuals’ GPS movement data).” |
| **G** | *Extracting features from text / image / audio data* – (any description of automatic extraction from unstructured media). |
| **Y** | **Other** – the excerpt mentions a valid feature‑enrichment method **not listed** above. |
| **Z** | **Not reported** – the excerpt contains **no** information about any feature‑enrichment method. |

**Instructions for Selecting Letters**

1. **Base your decision ONLY on the excerpt** provided. Do **not** infer, guess, or use outside knowledge.  
2. **Match the excerpt verbatim** (or paraphrase that preserves the meaning) to the definitions above. If the excerpt clearly describes a method that fits a definition, select that letter.  
3. **Multiple methods:** If more than one definition applies, list **all applicable letters** in **alphabetical order**, separated by commas **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
4. **Other:** If the excerpt describes a legitimate feature‑enrichment technique that does **not** correspond to any letter A‑G, select **Y** **in addition** to any other applicable letters.  
5. **Not reported:** If the excerpt contains **no** mention of any feature‑enrichment technique, output only `Z`.  
6. **Ambiguous or partial information:**  
   - If the excerpt is vague such that it could plausibly fit a definition but is **not explicitly stated**, treat it as **not reported** and answer `Z`.  
   - If the excerpt contains contradictory statements, prioritize the **explicitly stated** method(s) and ignore the contradictory part.  
7. **Output format:** Provide **exactly one line** containing only the selected letter(s) (or `Z`). Do **not** add explanations, headings, or any other text.

**Optional Reasoning (for internal use only)**  
If you find it helpful, you may briefly note which part of the excerpt matched each selected letter before producing the final answer, but **do not include that reasoning in the output**.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with **coding** a short excerpt from a research paper. The excerpt must be examined **strictly** for evidence of any of the listed feature‑engineering techniques.  

**Target variable**: *Feature engineering*  

**Coding scheme (answer letters)**  

| Letter | Technique (select if the excerpt explicitly reports this) |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | Standardization (z‑scores) |
| **B** | Centering |
| **C** | Min‑max scaling |
| **D** | Logarithmic transformation |
| **E** | Dimensionality reduction – if reported, note the specific method (e.g., PCA) in a **comment** after the answer list |
| **F** | Categorization – conversion of continuous/ordinal variables into categories (e.g., cut‑off scores) |
| **G** | Winsorization of outliers – extreme values are capped/replaced |
| **H** | Outlier masking + imputation – outliers first treated as missing, then imputed |
| **Y** | **Other** – the excerpt mentions a valid feature‑engineering step that is **not** listed above |
| **Z** | Not reported – the excerpt contains **no** information about any of the techniques above |

**Input**  
- **Excerpt**: `{context}` (the exact text to be evaluated)  

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Select every letter that is *explicitly* supported by the text.**  
   - The technique must be *clearly stated* (e.g., “we standardized all variables using z‑scores”).  
   - Do **not** infer, guess, or extrapolate from indirect language.  
3. **If the excerpt mentions a technique that does not appear in the table,** add the letter **Y** (Other).  
4. **If multiple techniques are reported,** list all applicable letters **in alphabetical order**, separated by commas (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
5. **If the excerpt provides no information about any technique,** output **only** the letter `Z`.  
6. **If you select letter E (Dimensionality reduction),** you must add a short comment in parentheses after the answer list indicating the specific method mentioned (e.g., `E (PCA)`). No comment is required for any other letter.  
7. **If the excerpt is ambiguous** (e.g., it hints at a technique but does not name it), treat it as *not reported* and answer `Z`.  
8. **Do not provide any explanation, rationale, or additional text** beyond the answer letters (and the optional comment for E).  

**Output format**  

- A single line containing only the selected letter(s) (and optional comment for E).  
- Examples:  
  - `A,B,F`  
  - `E (PCA),G`  
  - `Y`  
  - `Z`

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and indicate which machine‑learning algorithms (from the list below) are **explicitly mentioned** as being used for prediction.  

**Output Format**  
- Return **only** the capital letters that correspond to the applicable answer options, separated by commas and **without any spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If **no algorithm from the list** is mentioned, output the single letter `Z`.  
- If the excerpt mentions a correct algorithm **that is not** in the list, include the letter `Y` (the “Other” option) **in addition to any other applicable letters**.  
- Do **not** add explanations, comments, or any other text.

**How to Handle Edge Cases**  
1. **Exact wording required** – Only count an algorithm if the excerpt *clearly* names it (e.g., “Ridge Regression”, “Random Forest”). Do not infer a method from vague descriptions such as “a linear model” or “tree‑based methods” unless the specific name appears.  
2. **Multiple mentions** – If more than one algorithm from the list is named, list **all** corresponding letters.  
3. **Missing or ambiguous information** – If the excerpt provides no usable information about the algorithms, output `Z`.  
4. **Other algorithms** – If the excerpt names an algorithm that is **not** in the provided list (e.g., “Deep Neural Network”, “Support Vector Regression”), add `Y` to the answer. Do not attempt to map it to a listed option.  

**Answer Options (letter → algorithm)**  
A: Ridge Regression  
B: LASSO Regression  
C: Elastic Net Regression  
D: Bayesian Linear Regression  
E: Classification and Regression Trees (CART)  
F: Random Forest

# Examples:
Example: &quot;Thirteen machine learning algorithms were selected to provide a 
broad comparison (of a variety of modelling techniques) and to be 
consistent with research that has used similar methods (Webb et al., 
2020). To provide a benchmark against the machine learning models, an 
ordinary least squares regression (OLS) model with all the available 
same predictors (in the same manner as the machine learning models) 
was included. The multiple OLS acts as a comparator with penalised 
regression models by fitting the data without any regularisation, making 
it prone to overfitting compared to models with regularisation. Addi
tionally, two other comparison models akin to those used in similar 
research were fitted (Buckman et al., 2021a). The first was an OLS 
regression model with only the pre-treatment GAD-7 score included, as 
initial symptom severity is one of the most important factors considered 
by clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes (and allocating treat
ment) for their patients (Amati et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2021b; 
O’Driscoll et al., 2021). Separately, a null model was created using the 
mean post-treatment GAD-7 score in the training and validation dataset 
as the prediction for all test dataset cases. Five models based upon elastic 
net regularised regression (ENR; Friedman et al., 2010) were included 
(alpha parameters were 0.0; full ridge, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0; full 
lasso), using the ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection oper
ator (lasso) penalisations to reduce overfitting. Two spline regression 
models were used: adaptive splines (Friedman, 1991) and adaptive 
polynomial splines (Stone et al., 1997). In addition, two 
decision-tree-based algorithms were used: random forest (Breiman, 
2001) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., 
2010). Lastly, three support vector machines (SVM) were included with 
linear, polynomial and radial kernels (Dimitriadou et al., 2009). Full 
details of the models are presented in Supplementary Material 1 
(Table 3). 
SuperLearner (van der Laan et al., 2007), the chosen ensemble 
modelling tool, uses cross-validation to estimate the predictive perfor
mance of individual machine learning algorithms, and ultimately de
termines the most accurate model within the ensemble.&quot; (Section 2.4; p.2)
 True Answer: [&#x27;Y&#x27;]
 Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: &quot;Following that, we use a large database (n = 3385) of trait variables and leadership
 role occupancy to compare the predictive performance of traditional
 (parametric) linear models (LM) versus the non-parametric technique
 of randomforest(RF)analysis.&quot; (Introduction; p. 2)

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt and **assign every applicable code letter** from the list below that correctly describes the *inner‑loop resampling method* used in the study.  

**Instructions – follow these rules exactly**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Select all letters that apply** based strictly on what is *explicitly stated* in the excerpt.  
   - If the excerpt mentions a method that **matches one of the answer options**, choose the corresponding letter.  
   - If the excerpt mentions a correct method **not listed among the options**, choose **Y (Other)** *in addition to any other applicable letters*.  
   - If the excerpt contains **no information** about the inner‑loop resampling method, choose **Z (Not reported)** *and no other letters*.  
3. **Do not infer, guess, or extrapolate** beyond the exact wording of the excerpt.  
   - If the wording is ambiguous or could refer to more than one method, treat it as **not reported** and return **Z**.  
   - If the excerpt states that “the default method was used” without naming it, select **A** (Resampling method not specified, stated that default method was used).  
4. **Output format** – return a **single line** containing a comma‑separated list of the selected letters **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If only one letter applies, output that single letter (e.g., `D`).  
   - If multiple letters apply, list them in **alphabetical order**.  
5. **Do not provide any explanation, rationale, or additional text**—only the list of letters as described.  

**Target Variable**: Type of resampling method (inner loop) – see Section 3.2 “tunevalues”.

**Answer Options**  

- **A** – Resampling method not specified, stated that default method was used  
- **B** – Single k‑fold CV  
- **C** – Repeated k‑fold CV  
- **D** – Leave‑one‑out‑cross‑validation (LOOCV)

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are an expert research assistant. From the supplied excerpt, identify every performance metric that is **explicitly reported for the test set** and map each metric to the corresponding letter in the coding scheme below.

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Only use information that is **directly stated** in the text. Do not infer, guess, or add any information that is not present.  
2. **Identify all metrics** that are mentioned for the test set. A metric must be named exactly (e.g., “Mean Squared Error”, “RMSE”, “accuracy”, etc.).  
3. **Map each identified metric to the appropriate letter** from the answer list.  
   - If a metric is mentioned that does **not** appear in the list, also select the letter **Y (Other)**.  
   - If a metric appears more than once, list its letter only once.  
4. **Multiple metrics:** Return **all applicable letters**, separated by commas and **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`). The order of letters does not matter.  
5. **No metric found:** If the excerpt contains **no test‑set performance metric**, output only the single letter **Z**.  
6. **Ambiguous or partial information:** If the excerpt does not clearly state a metric (e.g., only hints at “good performance” without naming a specific measure), treat this as **no metric present** and answer **Z**.  
7. **Output format:** Provide **exactly one line** containing only the selected letter(s) (or `Z`). Do **not** include any explanation, commentary, or additional text.  

**Target Variable**

 Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: &quot;That said, we also found that RF outperformed LM. Of the top 238 observations predicted to be occupying a leadership role by the RF, 83 (34.9%) actually were in a leadership position. For the LM, 66 (27%) of the 238 individuals with leadership roles were identified. These percentages represent the sensitivity of the models — the proportion of individuals actually occupying a leadership role that are correctly identified as such (also called the true positive rate, the recall, or the probability of detection).&quot; (Section &quot;Cross-validation set&quot;; p.5)

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with classifying a single piece of information from a research‑paper excerpt according to a predefined coding scheme.

**Target Variable**  
*Performance metrics reported for training set*  

**Answer Options**  
1 – No  2 – Yes  Z – Information not present / cannot be determined from the excerpt  

**Instructions (must be followed exactly)**  

1. **Read the excerpt** provided in the placeholder `{context}`.  
2. **Determine whether the excerpt explicitly states** that performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss, AUC, F‑score, etc.) are reported **for the training set**.  
   - If the excerpt **clearly says that such metrics are reported for the training set**, select **2**.  
   - If the excerpt **clearly states that no performance metrics are reported for the training set**, select **1**.  
3. **If the excerpt does not contain any statement** about training‑set performance metrics, or the information is **absent, vague, or ambiguous**, answer **Z**.  
4. **Do not infer, guess, or add information** that is not explicitly present in the excerpt.  
5. **Return only the single character** (`1`, `2`, or `Z`). **No explanation, punctuation, or additional text** is allowed.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- **Multiple statements**: If both “metrics are reported” and “metrics are not reported” appear, choose the statement that directly refers to the *training set*. If conflict remains, treat it as ambiguous → answer **Z**.  
- **Partial information** (e.g., metrics reported for validation but not for training): treat as **Z** because the target variable concerns the training set specifically.  
- **Synonyms** (e.g., “learning set”, “development set”) are **not** considered training‑set unless the excerpt explicitly equates them.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:**  
Extract the numeric value for the **AUC** metric from the supplied excerpt of a research paper.

**Context:**  
You will be given a passage (`{context}`) that may contain performance results for classification or regression tasks.  

**Instructions (follow each step exactly):**  

1. **Identify AUC values**  
   - Search the excerpt for any reported AUC (Area‑Under‑the‑Curve) numbers.  
   - If multiple AUC values are present, select the **highest** one that corresponds to a validation sample (internal or external).  
   - Ignore AUC values that refer to training‐only results or to test sets that are not described as validation.

2. **Handle missing or ambiguous information**  
   - If the excerpt does **not** contain an AUC value, or the value cannot be unambiguously determined (e.g., it is described only qualitatively, or the number is tied to a different metric), output **`Z`**.  
   - Do **not** infer, estimate, or calculate the value from other statistics.

3. **Output format**  
   - Respond with **exactly one token**: the selected numeric value **as it appears** in the document (preserve decimal points, but omit any commas, units, or surrounding text), **or** the single character `Z`.  
   - No additional characters, explanations, units, or whitespace are allowed.

4. **Do not**  
   - Provide any reasoning, commentary, or justification.  
   - Alter the numeric value (e.g., rounding, converting scientific notation to plain decimal).  
   - Include any text other than the required token.

**Example (for illustration only, not part of the answer):**  
- Excerpt contains “The model achieved an AUC of 0.87 on the external validation set.” → Output: `0.87`  
- Excerpt contains no AUC information → Output: `Z`

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the numeric value for the target variable **ACC** from the supplied excerpt.

**Context:**  
{context}  

**Instructions**

1. **Identify the correct value**  
   - Look only for ACC values that are explicitly reported for a **validation** sample (internal validation or external validation).  
   - Do **not** use ACC values that are described as training‑set, test‑set, or any other non‑validation metric.  
   - If the excerpt lists several validation ACC numbers, **select the highest numeric value**.

2. **Handling missing or ambiguous information**  
   - If the excerpt contains **no explicit validation ACC value**, or the value is expressed only as a range, approximation (e.g., “≈”, “about”, “~”), or any non‑numeric description, treat it as **not reported** and answer with **`Z`**.  
   - Do **not** guess, estimate, or infer a number from context.

3. **Output format**  
   - Respond with **only** the selected number **exactly as it appears** (do not round, add units, commas, or extra characters).  
   - If no valid number can be determined, respond with the single character **`Z`**.  
   - No explanations, labels, or additional text are allowed.

4. **Optional internal reasoning (not part of the final answer)**  
   - You may note in your thoughts how you located the ACC value and why you chose the highest one, but the final line must contain **just** the number or `Z`.

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract a single numeric value from the supplied excerpt.  
**Target variable:** **BACC** (Balanced Accuracy)  

**Context:**  
{Insert excerpt here}

**Instructions**

1. **Locate the value** – Search the excerpt for the **highest** balanced‑accuracy (BACC) reported for any validation sample (internal or external).  
2. **Report the value** – Output **exactly the number** as it appears in the document (do not round, do not add commas, do not include units).  
3. **If the value cannot be found** – If the excerpt does not contain a BACC figure, or the figure is ambiguous (e.g., “≈”, “&gt;”, “around”, “estimated”, “not reported”), output the single character **`Z`**.  
4. **No additional text** – Do **not** add explanations, labels, units, or any other characters. The answer must be either the numeric string or `Z` alone.  
5. **Edge‑case handling**  
   - If multiple BACC numbers are presented, choose the **largest** one.  
   - If a range is given (e.g., “0.78‑0.82”), treat it as ambiguous and output `Z`.  
   - If the number is embedded in a sentence with qualifiers such as “approximately”, “about”, “~”, treat it as ambiguous → `Z`.  
   - If the number is expressed in scientific notation, retain the exact notation as shown (e.g., `9.1e‑2`).  

**Optional reasoning (for internal use only):**  
- Scan the excerpt for the keyword **BACC** (or “balanced accuracy”).  
- Identify any accompanying numeric expression.  
- Compare all identified BACC values and keep the maximum.  

**Answer format:**  
```
&lt;number&gt;   # or the single character Z
```  

**Example**  
- Excerpt contains “The best balanced accuracy on the external validation set was 0.84.” → **`0.84`**

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
Extract the numeric value for the target variable **R²** from the supplied excerpt of a research paper.  

**Context**  
You will be given a short passage (the *Excerpt*) taken verbatim from a research article. The passage may contain performance metrics for classification (AUC, ACC, BACC) and regression (R², r).  

**Output Format**  
Return **exactly** a JSON object with two fields:

```json
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &lt;number or &quot;Z&quot;&gt;,
  &quot;R2_version&quot;: &quot;&lt;text&gt;&quot;
}
```

* `value` – the numeric R² reported in the excerpt, **as it appears** (no rounding, no units).  
  *If the excerpt does not contain an R² value, or the value cannot be determined, set this field to the string `&quot;Z&quot;`.*  

* `R2_version` – a brief label of the R² variant the authors mention (e.g., `&quot;adjusted R²&quot;`, `&quot;pseudo‑R²&quot;`).  
  *If the excerpt mentions R² but does not specify a version, set this field to `&quot;not specified&quot;`.  
  If the excerpt contains no R² at all, also set this field to `&quot;not specified&quot;`.*

**Strict Extraction Rules**  

1. **Copy verbatim**: Use the exact numeric token from the excerpt; do not round, truncate, or convert units.  
2. **No inference**: Do not calculate, estimate, or infer R² from other numbers (e.g., from r or from model equations).  
3. **No additional text**: Apart from the JSON object above, output nothing else (no explanations, no comments).  
4. **Missing data**: If the excerpt provides no R² value, return `&quot;value&quot;: &quot;Z&quot;` and `&quot;R2_version&quot;: &quot;not specified&quot;`.  
5. **Ambiguity**: If multiple R² values appear, select the **highest** one reported for the validation sample (internal or external).  
6. **Version identification**: Look only for explicit qualifiers attached to R² (e.g., “adjusted”, “cross‑validated”, “pseudo”). If a qualifier is present, copy it exactly; otherwise use `&quot;not specified&quot;`.

**Optional Reasoning (do not include in final answer)**  
- Scan the excerpt for any occurrence of “R²”, “R-square”, or “R2”.  
- Record the numeric token that follows the first such occurrence (or the highest if several).  
- Check the surrounding words for version descriptors.  

**Example**  

*Excerpt:* “The model achieved an adjusted R² of 0.78 on the external validation set.”  

*Correct answer:*  

```json
{
  &quot;value&quot;: 0.78,
  &quot;R2_version&quot;: &quot;adjusted&quot;
}
```

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant whose sole job is to pull a single numeric value from a supplied excerpt of a research paper.  

**Target variable**: **r**  

**What to extract**  
- For **regression** studies, locate the reported **correlation coefficient (r)**.  
- If the paper reports multiple r values, choose the **highest** one that appears in the **validation** sample (internal or external).  
- If the excerpt contains only **R²** values, do **not** convert them; report **Z** unless an r value is explicitly given.  

**When to answer “Z”**  
- No r value is present in the excerpt.  
- The excerpt is ambiguous (e.g., “r was high” without a number).  
- The r is reported for a training set only, not for validation.  

**Output format**  
- **Exactly one token**: either the numeric value (e.g., `0.82`) **or** the single character `Z`.  
- Do **not** include units, commas, extra spaces, explanations, or any other text.  

**Step‑by‑step reasoning (optional, for internal use only)**  
1. Scan the excerpt for any numeric expression labeled “r”, “Pearson r”, “Spearman r”, etc.  
2. Verify that the surrounding text mentions a **validation** (internal or external) sample.  
3. If several such numbers exist, keep the largest one.  
4. If none meet the criteria, output `Z`.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**You are an expert research assistant.** Your task is to extract a single, exact piece of information from a research‑paper excerpt according to the coding scheme below.

---

### Target Variable  
**R² version** – the specific version of the coefficient of determination reported by the authors (e.g., “adjusted R²”, “pseudo‑R²”, “Nagelkerke R²”, “R²”, or “not specified”).

---

### Extraction Instructions  

1. **Read the excerpt** that follows the line `Excerpt:`.  
2. **Locate the exact wording** the authors use to describe the R² metric.  
   - If a version is explicitly named (e.g., “adjusted R²”, “Nagelkerke R²”, “pseudo‑R²”), copy that phrase **verbatim** (preserve case, spacing, and any hyphens).  
   - If the authors only write “R²” with no qualifier, answer with `R²`.  
   - If the authors do **not** mention any R² metric, answer with `Z`.  
3. **Do not** infer, guess, paraphrase, or add any extra words. Use only the exact token sequence that appears in the excerpt.  
4. **If multiple R² versions appear**, select the one presented as the primary result (the one associated with the highest reported performance). If you cannot determine which is primary, answer with `Z`.  
5. **If a numeric R² value is present but no version label**, treat the label as `R²`.  

---

### Output Format  

- Provide **exactly one short phrase** (or the single character `Z`) on the line that begins with `Answer:`.  
- No additional text, explanation, or punctuation (other than what appears in the extracted phrase) is allowed.  

---

### Edge‑Case Handling  

- **Embedded label**: If the label appears within a longer sentence (e.g., “we report the adjusted R² = 0.73”), extract only the label (`adjusted R²`).  
- **Hyphenation/spacing**: Preserve the original hyphenation and spacing exactly as in the source.  
- **Absent label**: Return `Z`.

You are a research‑assistant tasked with **classifying a single excerpt from a research paper** according to a predefined coding scheme.

---

### 1. Context (provided by the user)  
```
{context}
```

### 2. Target Variable  
**Confidence intervals for performance metrics** – determine whether the excerpt *explicitly* reports confidence intervals (or an equivalent statistical interval) for any performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1‑score, AUC, etc.).

### 3. Answer Options (choose **exactly one**)  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 1    | No – the excerpt does **not** contain any confidence interval (or equivalent) for a performance metric. |
| 2    | Yes – the excerpt **explicitly** includes a confidence interval (or equivalent) for a performance metric. |
| Z    | Not applicable – the excerpt provides **no information** about confidence intervals **and** it is impossible to determine presence or absence (e.g., the excerpt is unrelated, missing, or entirely ambiguous). |

---

### 4. Decision Rules  

1. **Strict textual evidence only** – select “2” only if the excerpt contains a clear statement such as “95 % CI = [0.78, 0.84]”, “confidence interval”, “credible interval”, “error bars representing …”, or any mathematically equivalent interval explicitly tied to a performance metric.  
2. Select “1” if the excerpt discusses performance metrics **without** any accompanying interval information.  
3. Select “Z” when:  
   - The excerpt does not mention performance metrics at all.  
   - The excerpt is so truncated or vague that you cannot ascertain whether an interval is present or absent.  
   - The excerpt refers to a figure/table without providing the interval values in text.  

4. **No inference or guesswork** – do not infer intervals from p‑values, standard deviations, or narrative descriptions unless the interval is explicitly stated.  

5. **Edge‑case handling** –  
   - If multiple intervals are reported, the presence of any one suffices for “2”.  
   - If the interval is reported for a *different* variable (e.g., a demographic characteristic) and not for a performance metric, treat it as “1”.  

---

### 5. Output Format  

- Return **only** the chosen code (`1`, `2`, or `Z`).  
- **Do not** include any explanation, punctuation, or additional characters (e.g., no “Answer:”, no newline before/after).  

**Example valid outputs:** `1` or `2` or `Z`

---

### 6. Optional Reasoning (for internal verification only)  

If you wish to double‑check your decision, you may briefly note the exact phrase that triggered your choice, but **do not** include this note in the final response.

**Instructions (follow in order)**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify every distinct statement that explicitly mentions a significance test** (e.g., p‑values, hypothesis tests, statistical comparisons).  
3. **Match each identified statement to the most appropriate letter** in the coding scheme:  
   - If the statement clearly refers to a significance test used **to compare models**, select **A**.  
   - If it clearly refers to a significance test used **to assess variable importance**, select **B**.  
   - If it clearly refers to a significance test used **for any other reported result** (e.g., group differences, treatment effects) and does **not** fit A or B, select **C**.  
   - If the excerpt mentions a significance test that does **not** fit A, B, or C (e.g., a novel or unspecified test), select **O**.  
4. **Multiple applicable codes:**  
   - If more than one distinct category applies, list **all applicable letters** in **alphabetical order**, separated by commas (e.g., `A,B,O`).  
5. **No applicable information:**  
   - If the excerpt contains **no mention** of any significance test, output only `Z`.  
6. **Do not infer or guess.**  
   - Only use a letter when the excerpt **explicitly** states the relevant information.  
   - Do not add any interpretation, summary, or explanation beyond the required letters.  
7. **Output format:**  
   - Provide **exactly one line** containing the selected letter(s) (or `Z`).  
   - No surrounding text, punctuation other than commas between letters, or whitespace.  

**Example**  
- *Excerpt*: “We performed a chi‑square test to compare the two classification models.”  
- *Answer*: `A`  

- *Excerpt*: “Variable importance was evaluated using permutation tests, and a t‑test was used to compare group means.”  
- *Answer*: `A,B`  

- *Excerpt*: “The paper does not report any statistical testing.”

# Examples:
Example: &quot;Using the model-specific explainability measures available, the in
clusion proportion for each individual feature used as a splitting rule 
within the BART tree was calculated (for further details: see Supple
mentary Material 1 Table 8).&quot; (Section 3.3; p.5)
 True Answer: [&#x27;Y&#x27;]
 Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: &quot;In order to explore the importance of each trait in predicting leadership role occupancy on the test data, we examined the increment in the prediction error after perturbing the predictors (Fisher, Rudin, &amp; Dominici, 2019). We perturbed single predictor variables by randomly changing their values 200 times and keeping all other values constant to calculate the “loss drop” in the test set. The loss drop refers to the increase in the quadratic mean of the difference between the predicted likelihood (ranging from 0% to 100%) and the actual leadership role occupancy (0% or 100%).Note that 11.4% of the individuals in the test set were in a leadership role, which means that if a model were to predict 0% (i.e., no leadership role occupancy) for each individual, the root mean squared error (RMSE) would have been 11.4%. Thus, the RMSE will increase when the perturbations result in a decrease (i.e., drop) in predictive performance.&quot; (Section &quot;RQ2a&quot;; p.6)

&quot;To further explore the interaction between BFI traits and NFC, we present the RF predictions on the test set against BFI and NFC scores in Fig. 5. In this figure, each person is denoted as either a blue circle or a gray triangle. Blue circles are used when the RF predicts leadership role occupancy (N = 129) and as gray triangles when the RF predicts no leadership role occupancy. As illustrated in Fig. 5, across all interactions, the RF frequently predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals scoring higher (at least 4) on NFC. Further, this higher NFC often resulted in predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals higher on openness (&gt;3.5), conscientiousness (&gt;3.0), and extraversion (&gt;3.0); lower on neuroticism (&gt;3.0); and not too high on agreeableness (&lt;4.5). Note that these findings are largely in line with the accumulated local effects plotted in Fig. 3, in which we visualized the effects of each trait separately.&quot; (Section RQ2c&quot;; p.8)

&quot;The importance of interactions between traits in predicting leadership role occupancy is visualized in Fig. 4a. This figure shows that NFC has the strongest interaction effect (H-statistic), meaning that interactions between NFC and the other traits contribute the most to leadership role occupancy predictions. To better understand the interactions between NFC and the other traits, we computed the H-statistic for each pair with NFC. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the interaction between openness and NFC contributed the most in predicting leadership role occupancy, which we explore next.&quot; (Section &quot;RQ2c&quot;; p. 8)

<td><pre>**Task**  
You are an expert research assistant. From the excerpt provided, identify every limitation that is **explicitly stated** in the paper’s discussion (or dedicated limitations) section and map it to the coding scheme below.

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Select all letters that correspond exactly to the limitations mentioned.**  
   - Use the codes listed in **Answer Options**.  
   - If a limitation is clearly present but does not match any of the listed codes, also select **Y (Other)**.  
   - If the excerpt contains **no limitation information**, output only **Z**.  
3. **Do not infer, guess, or add information** that is not verbatim in the excerpt.  
4. **Do not provide explanations, reasoning, or any text other than the required letters.**  
5. **Output format:** a single line containing the selected letters, separated by commas and **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If only one letter applies, output that single letter (e.g., `D`).  
   - If multiple apply, list them in **alphabetical order**.  
   - If “Other” is selected, include `Y` among the letters.  
   - If no limitation is present, output exactly `Z`.  

**Handling Edge Cases**  

- **Missing or ambiguous limitation:** If the excerpt mentions a possible limitation but the wording is vague or conditional (e.g., “might be a concern”), treat it as a limitation **only if the statement is unambiguous**. If still uncertain, **do not select any code** and answer `Z`.  
- **Multiple distinct limitations:** List every applicable code.  
- **Duplicate mentions:** Count each limitation only once.

# Examples:
Example: &quot;However, data came from 
services in similar geographical areas, so replication in other primary or 
community care mental health services that treat GAD, both within the 
UK and internationally (Cromarty et al., 2016; Knapstad et al., 2018) 
would provide a more thorough test of generalisability.&quot; (Section 4.1; p.5)

&quot;There was a large amount of unexplained variance for individual 
models, although this could be partly attributed to measurement error 
(Bone et al., 2021). Models might have been more accurate with a 
broader range of predictors, such as those collected through passive 
measurement of disorder-specific behaviours&quot;. (Section 4.1; p,6)

&quot; The hyperparameters were only tuned for 
the winning model from the first test of generalisation (i.e. the BART 
model), so an alternative potentially more accurate model could have 
been obtained if all models were tuned prior.&quot; (Section 4.1; p.6)
 True Answer: [&#x27;Y&#x27;]
 Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: &quot;First, though the amount of data we used here was large relative to typical datasets in leadership research, it was by no means “big data,” the space where machine learning is at its best (i.e., volume). Second, in efforts to advance the leader-trait paradigm, we focused on traits. However, several other features such as height and intelligence (Ilies et al., 2004) are important for leadership as well (i.e., variety). Third, we studied the leader trait cross-sectionally and did not focus on changes in the data, such as changes in leadership role occupancy — which would especially be interesting to monitor as changes in contextual factors such as market competition and disruption alter who is preferred as a leader (velocity). Fourth, though our sample is from a trusted source, using validated measures, there is the perennial concern with data quality (i.e., veracity). Scholars will need to remain vigilant when it comes to quality as the hunt for compelling datasets intensifies.&quot; (Section &quot;Discussion&quot;; p. 11)

Excerpt:

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with coding a single excerpt from a research paper. For each excerpt you must assign **exactly one** code from the list below that best reflects the authors’ statements about *generalizability of model performance and variable‑importance measures*.

**Instructions – Follow **strictly** the source excerpt; do not infer, guess, or add any information that is not explicitly present.**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Determine which of the three answer options (0, 1, 2) matches the authors’ statements** about generalizability, **or select “Z”** if the excerpt contains no relevant information.  
3. **Return ONLY the selected symbol** (e.g., `1` or `Z`). **No additional text, explanations, or formatting** is allowed.  

**Handling Missing or Ambiguous Information**  
- If the excerpt **does not mention generalizability at all**, output `Z`.  
- If the excerpt contains **multiple statements that belong to different categories**, choose the category that best captures the *overall* stance, prioritizing the most explicit claim.  
- If the excerpt is **unclear or contradictory**, default to the most conservative interpretation (i.e., the lower‑numbered applicable code).  

**Answer Options (choose one)**  

| Code | Meaning (must be explicitly stated in the excerpt) |
|------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **0** | No statements regarding generalizability are present. |
| **1** | Authors claim that their model(s) **generalize beyond the sampled data** (e.g., “our model trained on U.S. participants is applicable to other cultures”). |
| **2** | Authors limit their conclusions **to the analyzed data** or explicitly **question** any generalization beyond the sampling frame (e.g., “results may not hold in other regions”). |
| **Z** | The excerpt provides **no information** about generalizability (i.e., none of the above apply). |

**Optional Reasoning (for internal verification only – do NOT output)**  
- Identify any sentence that directly mentions “generalize”, “extend to”, “apply to other populations”, or similar phrasing.  
- Verify whether the wording is **definitive** (supporting Code 1) or **cautious/limiting** (supporting Code 2).  
- If no such wording exists, assign Code 0 or Z as appropriate.

**Input Format**

Target Variable: Generalizability of model performance and variable importance measures  
Excerpt:  
{context}  

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>Example 1:
Extract from paper: &lt;The study examined the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance among high‑school students in a single urban district. No claims are made about how these findings might apply to other age groups, regions, or educational systems./&gt;
True Answer: 0
Example 2:
Extract from paper: &lt;Using a machine‑learning classifier trained on a U.S. national health survey, we achieved an AUC of 0.87. We anticipate that this model will generalize to health datasets from other countries, given the universal nature of the physiological predictors employed./&gt;
True Answer: 1</pre></td>
<td><pre>You are an expert research assistant. Your task is to classify information from research paper excerpts according to a predefined coding scheme.
Instructions:
Select exactly one number that best applies, based strictly on the provided document.
Return only the number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) with no explanation or additional text.
If the requested information is not present in the excerpt, answer with Z.

Target Variable: Generalizability of model performance and variable importance measures
Description: ; 
Answer Options: 0: No statements regarding generalizability
1: Statements are extended to data outside the data sampling frame - Authors claim their models generalize to populations or contexts beyond the one studied (e.g., a model trained on a U.S. sample is said to generalize across cultures).
2: Statements are made with respect to the data analyzed / generalizability outside the sampling frame is questioned. - Claims are restricted to the analyzed data and/or generalization beyond it is explicitly questioned (e.g., results based on one region are stated not to generalize elsewhere).

# Examples:
Example: &quot;However, data came from 
services in similar geographical areas, so replication in other primary or 
community care mental health services that treat GAD, both within the 
UK and internationally (Cromarty et al., 2016; Knapstad et al., 2018) 
would provide a more thorough test of generalisability.&quot; (Section 4.1; p.5)
