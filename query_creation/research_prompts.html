<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with classifying a short excerpt from a research paper according to a fixed coding scheme.

**Input Provided**  
- **Target Variable:** *Open code*  
- **Description of the variable:** *(none – the variable is binary)*  
- **Answer Options:**  
  1️⃣ No  
  2️⃣ Yes  
- **Excerpt:** `{context}` (the text you must examine)

**Instructions – Follow Exactly**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Determine whether the excerpt contains any statement that directly indicates the presence of the target variable (“Open code”).**  
   - If the excerpt **clearly states** that the variable is present, select **2**.  
   - If the excerpt **clearly states** that the variable is absent, select **1**.  
3. **If the excerpt provides no information about the variable (i.e., the variable is not mentioned, the mention is ambiguous, or the text is unrelated), answer with the single character **`Z`**.**  
4. **Do not infer, guess, or extrapolate beyond what is explicitly written.**  
   - *Ambiguous wording* (e.g., “might be,” “could suggest,” “possible”) counts as **no information** → answer **`Z`**.  
   - *Contradictory statements* within the same excerpt: if any statement unambiguously affirms the variable, choose **2**; if any unambiguously denies it and none affirms it, choose **1**. If both affirmation and denial appear without clear dominance, treat the excerpt as ambiguous → answer **`Z`**.  
5. **Output format:**  
   - Return **only a single token**: `1`, `2`, or `Z`.  
   - No additional words, punctuation, explanations, or whitespace.  

**Optional Reasoning (for internal use only – do not include in the final answer)**  
- Briefly note the exact sentence(s) that led to your decision, then discard them before providing the final token.  

**Example**  
```
Excerpt: “Our analysis shows that Open code was implemented in 78% of the cases.”  
Answer: 2

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt from a research paper and **assign the correct code‑letter(s)** that represent the programming language(s) used for the machine‑learning computations reported in the study.

**Target Variable**  
*Programming language used for ML‑related computations (as reported in the article).*

**Coding Rules**  

1. **Select only the letters that are explicitly supported by the excerpt.**  
   - If the excerpt directly names a programming language, choose the corresponding letter.  
   - If the excerpt does **not** name a language but mentions a software package that is **uniquely tied** to a single language (e.g., *tidyverse* → R, *scikit‑learn* → Python), record that language’s letter.  
   - If the excerpt mentions **more than one** language (or more than one uniquely‑linked package), list **all applicable letters**.  

2. **“Other” (letter Y)**  
   - Use Y only when the excerpt clearly indicates a programming language that is **not** and **cannot be mapped** to any of the listed options (A–G).**  
   - Do **not** use Y for ambiguous or missing information.

3. **No information present** – use **Z** when the excerpt provides no evidence of any programming language (including no uniquely‑linked packages).

4. **Multiple selections**  
   - Return letters **in alphabetical order**, separated by commas with **no spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  

5. **Missing or ambiguous data**  
   - If the excerpt is ambiguous, contradictory, or does not allow a confident determination, treat it as “no information” and answer **Z**.

6. **Strict compliance**  
   - Do **not** guess, infer, or add any interpretation beyond what is stated or uniquely implied by the excerpt.  
   - Do **not** provide explanations, comments, or any text other than the final code string.

**Answer Options**

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Classify the excerpt according to the coding scheme for **“Programming language version reported.”**  

**Context:**  
The excerpt from the research paper will be inserted where `{context}` appears.

**Instructions**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Determine whether the authors explicitly state the exact version of the programming language they used (e.g., “Python 3.9”, “R 4.2.1”).**  
3. **Select **exactly one** of the following response codes:**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **1** | The excerpt **does not** contain any programming‑language version information. |
| **2** | The excerpt **does** contain an explicit version statement (e.g., “Python 3.9”, “R 4.2.1”). |
| **Z** | The excerpt is **incomplete or missing** (e.g., empty, corrupted) **or** the requested information is impossible to locate because the excerpt does not provide any relevant content. |

4. **Do not** infer, guess, or extrapolate version numbers from indirect statements (e.g., “we used the latest version” or “Python 3.x”). Only count a version if it is explicitly specified.  
5. **If the excerpt contains conflicting information** (e.g., two different versions), treat it as “Yes – version reported” and return **2**.  
6. **If the excerpt is ambiguous** (e.g., mentions only the language name without a version), treat it as “No” and return **1**.  
7. **Output**: Return **only** the single code (`1`, `2`, or `Z`) on a line by itself. No explanations, comments, or additional characters are allowed.

**Example**  

- Excerpt: “All analyses were performed in R 4.2.1.” → **2**  
- Excerpt: “We used Python for data processing.” → **1**  
- Excerpt: *(empty)* → **Z**

1. **Strictly copy** each name from the excerpt; do not modify spelling, capitalization, or punctuation.  
2. Only include items that are clearly identified as an ML package/library/framework (e.g., “TensorFlow”, “scikit‑learn”, “PyTorch”).  
3. If a term could be interpreted in multiple ways (e.g., a common word that is also a library name) and the excerpt does not make it unambiguous, **treat it as not present** and do not list it.  
4. Do **not** infer or guess missing information; if the excerpt does not contain any qualifying name, output `Z`.  
5. If the same name appears multiple times, list it **only once**.  

**Optional Reasoning (internal, not part of the answer)**

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify each research‑paper excerpt according to whether the authors explicitly report the version numbers of any machine‑learning‑related packages, libraries, or modeling frameworks.

**Target Variable:** *Package / library / modeling framework version reported*  

**Answer Options (choose **exactly one**):**  
- `1` – **No**: The excerpt does **not** contain an explicit version number for any ML‑related package, library, or framework.  
- `2` – **Yes**: The excerpt contains at least one explicit version number (e.g., “scikit‑learn 1.2.2”, “caret 6.0‑93”, “mlr3 0.15.0”).  
- `Z` – **Not present**: The excerpt provides no information about package/library/framework versions **and** it is impossible to determine from the given text whether such information exists (e.g., the excerpt is unrelated or truncated).

**Instructions:**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text that replaces `{context}`) **carefully**.  
2. Determine whether the excerpt contains an **explicit** version string for any ML‑related package, library, or framework.  
   - An explicit version string must include a numeric version (e.g., “1.2.2”, “6.0‑93”, “v0.15.0”).  
   - Mentions of a package *without* a version (e.g., “we used scikit‑learn”) count as **No (1)**.  
3. If the excerpt **clearly** includes such a version, answer **`2`**.  
4. If the excerpt **clearly does not** include any version information, answer **`1`**.  
5. If the excerpt **does not address** the target variable at all (e.g., it is about study design, results, or is missing relevant text), answer **`Z`**.  
6. **Do not infer** version numbers from context, citations, or external knowledge; only use what is *explicitly* written in the excerpt.  
7. **Return only the single character** (`1`, `2`, or `Z`). No explanations, spaces, line breaks, or additional text are allowed.

<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify the availability of “Open data” in the supplied research‑paper excerpt according to the coding scheme below.

**Instructions (follow *exactly*):**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text that appears after `Excerpt:`).  
2. **Determine which single code** (0‑4 or **Z**) best describes the data‑availability situation **based solely on the information explicitly stated in the excerpt**.  
   - **Do not infer, guess, or add information** that is not present.  
   - **If the excerpt provides no statement about data availability**, choose **Z**.  
3. **Return only the selected code** (e.g., `2` or `Z`).  
   - No additional words, punctuation, or explanations are allowed.  
4. **If multiple codes appear to apply**, select the **most specific** one according to the hierarchy listed in the coding scheme (see step 5).  

**Coding Scheme (choose exactly one):**  

| Code | Meaning (must match the excerpt verbatim or by clear implication) |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0** | *Not available* – The excerpt says the original or pre‑processed data are **not mentioned**, **unavailable**, or **cannot be accessed** (e.g., private repository, broken link, no access information). |
| **1** | *Available upon request* – The excerpt states that the data can be obtained **only by contacting the authors** (no public link). |
| **2** | *Synthetic data only* – The excerpt indicates that **only synthetic or simulated data** are provided; **no original or pre‑processed data** exist. |
| **3** | *Public repository (restricted or open)* – The excerpt notes that the data are deposited in a **public repository**, even if access requires registration, an agreement, or similar restrictions. |

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt from a research paper and determine whether the study was **preregistered** according to the coding scheme below.

**Coding Scheme (choose **exactly one** option)**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| 1    | The excerpt states **explicitly that the study was *not* preregistered** (e.g., “the study was not preregistered,” “no preregistration was performed,” etc.). |
| 2    | The excerpt states **explicitly that the study *was* preregistered** (e.g., “the study was preregistered,” “preregistration was completed on…”, “the protocol is available at…”, etc.). |
| Z    | The excerpt **does not contain any information** about preregistration, or the information is ambiguous/unclear (e.g., no mention of preregistration, only a vague reference that does not confirm presence or absence). |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (provided in the placeholder `{context}`) **carefully**.  
2. **Identify any statement that directly addresses preregistration**.  
   - If the statement **clearly affirms** preregistration → select **2**.  
   - If the statement **clearly denies** preregistration → select **1**.  
   - If the excerpt **contains no such statement** or the wording is **ambiguous** (e.g., “we followed standard procedures” without specifying preregistration) → select **Z**.  
3. **Do not infer** preregistration from indirect clues (e.g., presence of a registration number without a statement, references to a protocol repository, or typical best‑practice language). Only explicit statements count.  
4. **Do not consider information outside the excerpt**; ignore any prior knowledge you may have about the paper.  
5. **Output** **only** the single chosen code (`1`, `2`, or `Z`). **No additional text, explanation, or formatting** is allowed.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- **Multiple conflicting statements**: If the excerpt contains both a positive and a negative statement, prioritize the **most explicit** one (e.g., “the study was preregistered” overrides a later “no preregistration was performed” only if the latter is clearly qualified as a different component). If the conflict cannot be resolved, treat the information as ambiguous → output **Z**.  
- **Partial information** (e.g., “preregistration is planned” or “preregistration will be completed”) → treat as **absence of confirmation** → output **Z**.  
- **References to a registration number without a surrounding statement** → output **Z** (the number alone does not confirm preregistration).  

**Reasoning (internal, not to be output)**  

- Scan for keywords: “preregistered”, “preregistration”, “registered before data collection”, “pre‑analysis plan”, “protocol posted”, etc.  
- Verify that the keyword is accompanied by a **clear affirmative** (“was”, “has been”, “is available”) or **clear negative** (“was not”, “no preregistration”).  
- If none are found, or the language is vague, select **Z**.  

**Now perform the classification**

Description: ; 
Excerpt:
{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract a single numeric value from the supplied excerpt of a research paper.

**Target Variable**  
- **Name:** Number of predictor variables used in the final analysis  
- **What to return:** The exact integer (or decimal, if the source reports a non‑integer) that appears in the text and represents the count of predictor variables included in the final statistical model.

**Input Provided**  
- `Excerpt:` *{context}* – a verbatim excerpt from the paper.

**Output Requirements**  
- If the excerpt **clearly states** the number of predictor variables, output **only that number** (no commas, no spaces, no units, no surrounding text).  
- If the excerpt **does not contain** this information, is ambiguous, or the number cannot be unambiguously identified, output **the single character `Z`**.  
- Do **not** infer, estimate, or calculate the value from other data; use only the explicit value presented in the excerpt.  
- Do **not** add explanations, reasoning, or any additional characters.

**Handling Edge Cases**  
1. **Multiple numbers present:** Choose the one that the text explicitly ties to “predictor variables” or “covariates” in the final analysis. If none are explicitly linked, treat the information as missing → output `Z`.  
2. **Ranges or approximations (e.g., “between 5 and 7 predictors”):** Treat as ambiguous → output `Z`.  
3. **Non‑numeric descriptors (e.g., “several predictors”, “a large number of variables”):** Output `Z`.  
4. **Formatting variations (e.g., “5‑variable model”, “5 variables”):** Accept the numeric component (e.g., `5`).  

**Procedure**  
1. Read the excerpt carefully.  
2. Locate any sentence that directly states the count of predictor variables used in the final analysis.  
3. Verify that the number is unequivocally associated with that count.  
4. Return the number alone; otherwise return `Z`.

**Example**  
- Excerpt: “The final logistic regression included **12 predictor variables** after backward selection.” → Output: `12`  
- Excerpt: “We considered several covariates, but the final model’s composition is not reported.” → Output: `Z`

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant whose sole job is to pull a single numeric value from the supplied excerpt.

**Target Variable**  
*Number of cases (observations) in the minority class* – i.e., the smallest reported count for any outcome category in a classification dataset.

**Output Requirements**  

* Return **exactly one token**: either the integer count for the minority class **or** the single letter **`Z`**.  
* Do **not** include commas, spaces, units, explanations, or any additional characters.  
* If the excerpt contains **no clear, unambiguous count** for any class, or if the counts are presented in a way that makes it impossible to determine which class is the minority, answer **`Z`**.

**Step‑by‑Step Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text placed where `{context}` appears).  
2. **Identify every explicit numeric count** that refers to the number of cases for a specific class.  
   * Accept numbers written as digits (e.g., `42`) or as words (e.g., `forty‑two`). Convert word‑forms to digits.  
   * Ignore any other numbers (e.g., percentages, p‑values, years) that are **not** described as “cases”, “samples”, “observations”, “subjects”, etc. for a class.  
3. **Determine the minority class**:  
   * If you have **one** count → that is the minority count.  
   * If you have **multiple counts**, compare them numerically. The smallest count is the minority count.  
   * If two or more counts are tied for the smallest value, the situation is ambiguous → output `Z`.  
4. **Missing or ambiguous information**:  
   * If **no** class count is found, or the excerpt says something like “the minority class size was not reported”, output `Z`.  
   * If the excerpt provides only a range (e.g., “between 30 and 40 cases”) without a single definitive number, output `Z`.  
5. **Produce the answer**: Write only the integer you derived or `Z`. No surrounding text.

<td><pre>**Task**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to extract the **Country of data acquisition** from a research‑paper excerpt and encode it using the coding scheme below.

**Procedure**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text will appear in the placeholder `{context}`) carefully.  
2. **Identify any country** that is explicitly mentioned as the location where multiple countries are listed, record each one.  
   - If only a city, state, province, or region is mentioned, map it to its **unambiguous** country (e.g., “Paris” → France).  
   - If the place name could refer to more than one country (e.g., “Springfield”), treat the information as **unavailable**.  
3. **Match each identified country** to the answer options:  
   - Use the letter that corresponds to the country (see the list).  
   - If the excerpt mentions a country not present in the list, select **Y (Other)**.  
   - If the excerpt states the data are “cross‑cultural” or involve multiple unspecified countries, select **A (Cross‑cultural)**.  
4. **If no country can be unambiguously assigned** from the excerpt (including ambiguous place names), output **Z**.  
5. **Do not infer, guess, or add any information** that is not explicitly present in the excerpt.  
6. **Do not provide explanations or any extra text**—only the answer code(s).

**Output format**  

- Return **exactly one line** containing only the selected letter(s).  
- If the answer includes multiple letters, separate them with commas **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If there is only one letter, output that letter alone (e.g., `B`).

Excerpt:
{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You will read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign every letter that correctly describes the *data type of the predictor variables* mentioned in the excerpt. The coding scheme is fixed and must be followed exactly.

**How to respond**  
- Return **only** the selected letters, **in alphabetical order**, separated by commas (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- **Do not** include any explanation, commentary, or additional characters.  
- If the excerpt contains **no information** about the data type, answer with the single letter `Z`.  
- If the excerpt indicates a data type that is **not listed** among the answer options, select the letter **`O`** (stands for “Other”).  
- If more than one data type applies, list **all** applicable letters (including `O` if needed).  

**Handling special cases**  
- **Missing information** – If the excerpt does not mention any predictor‑variable data type, output `Z`.  
- **Ambiguous or contradictory statements** – If the excerpt does not make a clear, unambiguous claim about a data type, treat it as missing information and answer `Z`.  
- **Multiple valid data types** – Include every letter that is explicitly supported by the text. Do not infer or guess beyond what is stated.  

**Coding scheme**  

| Letter | Description (what to select) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **A** | Behavioral observation data – systematic recordings or codings of observable actions or interactions (e.g., classroom participation, gaze behavior). |
| **B** | Performance data – outcomes from task‑based assessments measured by accuracy, speed, etc. (e.g., IQ scores, reaction time). |
| **C** | Digital trace data – automatically logged behavioral data from digital devices/platforms (e.g., screen time, app usage, GPS). |
| **D** | Higher‑dimensional data from text / image / audio – features extracted from unstructured modalities (e.g., text embeddings, image pixels, audio spectrograms). |
| **E** | Biophysical measures – quantitative biological or physiological measurements (e.g., genetic markers, hormone levels, heart rate variability). |
| **F** | Rating / judgement data – structured evaluations on rating scales or subjective judgments (e.g., Likert responses, observer ratings). |
| **G** | Demographic / biographical data – factual records about personal characteristics (e.g., age, education, medical diagnoses). |
| **H** | Contextual / aggregate data – features describing the broader environment or context (e.g., regional income, school‑level ratios). |
| **O** | Other – the excerpt specifies a data type that does **not** fit any of the categories above. |
| **Z** | None – the excerpt provides no information about predictor‑variable data type. |

**Input format**  

```
Excerpt: {your excerpt here}
```

**Output example**  

- If the excerpt mentions both behavioral observation data and rating data → `A,F`  
- If the excerpt mentions a data type not listed → `O`  
- If the excerpt contains no relevant information → `Z`

{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper (the *Excerpt*) and assign every applicable code letter from the list below. The coding must reflect **only** what is explicitly stated in the excerpt; do not infer, extrapolate, or add information that is not present.

**Output Requirements**  

- Return **only** a comma‑free list of capital letters (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If more than one code applies, list **all** applicable letters in **alphabetical order**, separated by commas.  
- If the excerpt contains a correct answer that does **not** match any of the listed options, include the letter **`O`** (for “Other”).  
- If the excerpt contains **no information** about the target variable, output **`Z`**.  
- **Never** add explanations, comments, or any text other than the letters described above.  

**Handling Edge Cases**  

1. **Missing Information** – If the excerpt does not mention the data type of the outcome variable at all, answer `Z`.  
2. **Ambiguous or Partial Mentions** – Only code a category when the excerpt **clearly** and **unambiguously** describes that data type. If the description could fit multiple categories, select **all** that are clearly supported.  
3. **“Other” Category** – Use `O` only when the excerpt states a data type that is not captured by options A‑H (e.g., a novel modality). Do not use `O` when the excerpt is silent or when the described data fits an existing option.  

**Target Variable**  
*Data type of the outcome variable* – focus on the **modality** of the data (behavioural, physiological, digital, etc.), not on where or how it was collected.

**Answer Options**  

| Letter | Definition (exact wording to match) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| **A** | **Behavioral observation data** – systematic recordings or codings of observable actions or interactions, typically in naturalistic or structured settings (e.g., classroom participation, gaze behavior, social engagement). |
| **B** | **Performance data** – data derived from task‑based or ability‑driven assessments that yield quantifiable outcomes based on accuracy, speed, or other performance metrics (e.g., IQ scores, reaction time, cognitive‑task results). |
| **C** | **Digital trace data** – automatically logged behavioural data from digital devices or platforms, typically passively collected (e.g., screen time, app usage, GPS location, typing dynamics). |
| **D** | **Higher‑dimensional data from text / image / audio** – extracted features derived from unstructured data modalities such as natural language, visual input, or sound (e.g., text embeddings, pixel‑based image features, spectrogram‑based audio features). |
| **E** | **Biophysical measures** – quantitative measurements of biological or physiological structures or functions (e.g., genetic markers, hormone levels, heart‑rate variability). |
| **F** | **Rating / judgement data** – structured evaluations based on rating scales or subjective judgments, typically collected through self‑report questionnaires or external assessments (e.g., Likert‑scale responses, observer ratings). |
| **G** | **Demographic / biographical data** – factual or historical records about an individual’s life circumstances or traits (e.g., age, marital status, education history, medical diagnoses). |
| **H** | **Contextual / aggregate data** – data referring to features of the broader environment or context in which the individual is embedded (e.g., average income in a region, school‑level teacher‑student ratios, therapist gender in multi‑level data). |
| **O** | **Other** – the excerpt mentions a data type that does not fit any of the definitions above. |
| **Z** | **None** – the excerpt provides no information about the outcome‑variable data type. |

**Procedure**  

1. Read the **Excerpt** carefully.  
2. Identify every data‑type description that matches one (or more) of the definitions A‑H.  
3. If a description matches none of A‑H, add `O`.  
4. If the excerpt contains **no** relevant description, output `Z`.  
5. List the selected letters in alphabetical order, separated by commas, with no extra spaces or characters.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and extract **exactly** the information that corresponds to the *Target Variable* defined below.

---

### Target Variable  
**Prediction task including outcome** – a brief, open‑ended label that names the predicted outcome studied (e.g., “Predicting students‑at‑risk in language acquisition”, “Predicting recidivism in major depression”).  

The answer must be a **direct quote** (or the exact phrase) taken verbatim from the excerpt. Do **not** paraphrase, re‑word, or add any additional text.

---

### Extraction Instructions  

1. **Locate the answer**  
   - Scan the excerpt for a phrase that explicitly names the prediction task or outcome.  
   - If the excerpt contains more than one possible phrase, choose the **first** one that matches the definition.

2. **Copy the phrase exactly**  
   - Preserve spelling, capitalization, and punctuation exactly as it appears in the source.  
   - Output only the phrase—no surrounding sentences, no quotes, no brackets.

3. **Missing information**  
   - If the excerpt does **not** contain any phrase that fits the definition, output the single character **`Z`** (capital Z) and nothing else.

4. **Edge‑case handling**  
   - If the phrase is split across a line break or hyphenated, reconstruct it as it appears in the continuous text (do not insert or remove hyphens).  
   - If the phrase includes a citation or reference number (e.g., “[12]”), **exclude** the citation from the answer.  
   - If the phrase is embedded within a longer sentence, extract only the core label that describes the prediction task (e.g., from “The study focuses on predicting student‑at‑risk status in language acquisition.” extract **`predicting student‑at‑risk status in language acquisition`**).

5. **No additional output**  
   - Do not include explanations, reasoning, or any extra characters (including spaces before or after the answer).  

---

### Input Format  

```
Excerpt:
{context}
```

Replace `{context}` with the provided excerpt.

---

### Output Format  

- A single line containing either the exact phrase (as described) **or** the character `Z`.  

---

**Example**

*Excerpt:*  
“The primary aim of this work is **predicting recidivism in major depression** using machine‑learning models.”

*Output:*  
`predicting recidivism in major depression`

- Return **exactly one token**: the number that corresponds to the correct answer option **or** the single character **`Z`** if the excerpt does **not** contain any information about the outcome variable type.  
- **No additional text, explanations, or formatting** (e.g., no “Answer:”, no brackets).  

**Answer Options**  

| Code | Variable Type | Definition (examples) |
|------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **1** | Binary | Exactly two mutually exclusive categories (e.g., “suicide attempt: yes / no”). |
| **2** | Nominal categorical | More than two unordered categories (e.g., “attachment style: secure / anxious / avoidant / disorganized”). |
| **3** | Ordinal categorical | Categories with a natural order (e.g., “job position: intern → junior → senior → manager → executive”). |
| **4** | Continuous | Measured on an interval/ratio scale with numeric values and meaningful distances (e.g., IQ score).  

**Step‑by‑Step Guidance (optional, for internal reasoning – do not output)**  

1. **Locate the outcome variable** in the excerpt.  
2. **Determine its measurement scale** using the definitions above.  
3. **Select the single most specific code** that fits the description:  
   - If the variable is described as “yes/no”, “present/absent”, etc., choose **1**.  
   - If it has three or more categories and no ordering is mentioned, choose **2**.  
   - If the categories are explicitly ordered, choose **3**.  
   - If the variable is a numeric score, distance, or any measurement on a continuous scale, choose **4**.  
4. **If the excerpt provides no information about the outcome variable type** (e.g., the variable is not mentioned, or its scale is unclear), output **`Z`**.  
5. **Do not infer** the variable type from context outside the excerpt; rely only on explicit statements.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- **Multiple variable types mentioned**: If the excerpt describes more than one outcome variable, choose the code that applies to the *primary* outcome as indicated by the authors (usually the first or the one labeled “primary outcome”).  
- **Ambiguous wording** (e.g., “high/low”, “good/bad” without clarification): treat as **binary** (**1**) only if the authors explicitly state there are exactly two categories. Otherwise, output **`Z`**.  
- **Mixed descriptors** (e.g., “score ranging from 0–100”): treat as **continuous** (**4**) unless the authors explicitly label the score as “categorical”.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code from the list below that best describes the temporal relationship between the predictor(s) and the outcome described in the excerpt.

**Target Variable**  
*Longitudinal prediction* – whether the outcome is measured **after** the predictor data have been collected (i.e., truly future‑looking).

**Answer Options**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **1** | **No** – The outcome is already known or is measured at the same time as (any part of) the predictor data (e.g., predicting personality traits from concurrent music‑listening behavior). |
| **2** | **Yes** – The outcome occurs **later** than the predictor data and is unknown at the time the predictors are collected (e.g., predicting relapse or therapy dropout from baseline measures). |
| **Z** | The excerpt does **not** contain any information that allows you to decide between codes 1 or 2 (i.e., the relevant temporal relationship is missing, unclear, or ambiguous). |

**Instructions – What to Do**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (provided in the placeholder `{context}`) carefully.  
2. **Determine** whether the excerpt states that the outcome is already known/measured concurrently with the predictor (code 1) **or** that the outcome will occur in the future relative to the predictor (code 2).  
3. **If the excerpt gives no explicit information** about the timing of the outcome, or if the timing is ambiguous or contradictory, **select code Z**.  
4. **Do not infer** missing details, make assumptions, or add any interpretation that is not explicitly present in the text.  
5. **Return only the single code** (`1`, `2`, or `Z`). **No explanations, no extra characters, no whitespace before or after the code.**

**Handling Edge Cases**  

- **Multiple outcomes**: If the excerpt mentions both a concurrent and a future outcome, choose the code that matches the **primary** outcome described (the one the authors focus on).  
- **Implicit timing**: If the timing can only be guessed (e.g., “we will examine … later” without a clear link to the predictor), treat it as **missing** and answer `Z`.  
- **Contradictory statements**: When the excerpt contains conflicting information about timing, default to `Z`.  

**Optional Reasoning (for internal checking only)**  

- If you wish, you may mentally note the sentence(s) that justify your choice, but **do not include this reasoning in the final answer**.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a single excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code from the predefined coding scheme that best describes how the paper reports missing data.

**Target Variable**  
*Reporting of missingness*

**Coding Scheme**  

| Code | Meaning (must match the excerpt *exactly*) |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| **0** | **Not reported** – The excerpt contains **no** description of the amount or nature of missing data. |
| **1** | **General statement** – The authors mention missingness only qualitatively (e.g., “low missingness”) **or** give a single quantitative summary that applies to the whole dataset (e.g., “overall 5 % missing”). |
| **2** | **Descriptives on variable level** – The authors provide missing‑data counts or percentages **for each individual variable** (or for a specific set of variables). |
| **Z** | **Information absent** – The excerpt does not contain any information about missing data (i.e., the question asked cannot be answered from the provided text). |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text between the markers `Excerpt:` and `Answer:`).  
2. **Determine which single code (0, 1, 2, or Z) best matches the excerpt** according to the definitions above.  
3. **Output ONLY the chosen code** (e.g., `1`). **Do not** add explanations, punctuation, or any other characters.  
4. **Do not infer** missing‑data information that is not explicitly stated. If the excerpt is ambiguous or could fit more than one code, choose the **lowest‑level** code that is definitely supported (e.g., prefer 0 over 1 if you cannot confirm a general statement).  
5. **If the excerpt contains contradictory statements** (e.g., both a general statement and variable‑level details), select the **higher‑level** code that captures the most specific reporting (i.e., 2 over 1).  
6. **If the excerpt is empty, unrelated, or offers no insight into missingness**, answer with `Z`.  

**Optional Reasoning (for internal checking only)**  
- Briefly note why the chosen code fits (you may keep this in your notes, but **do not** include it in the final answer).

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant whose sole job is to read the supplied excerpt from a research paper and indicate, **exactly**, which of the predefined coding categories apply to the way the authors handle missing data.

**Input**  
- `Excerpt:` The passage of text to be examined (provided in the placeholder `{context}`).

**Output Format**  
- Return **only** a comma‑separated list of capital letters, **without any spaces or additional characters**.  
  - Example of a valid answer: `A,C,E`  
  - If **none** of the categories are mentioned, output `Z`.  
  - If the excerpt mentions a correct handling method that is **not** among the listed categories, include the letter `Y` (the “Other” category) **in addition** to any other applicable letters.  

**Answer Options (exact wording must be respected)**  

| Letter | Category (as described in the paper) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| A | Listwise deletion |
| B | Threshold‑based deletion – an observation is excluded if it has any missing values on the variables included, i.e., only complete cases are analyzed. |
| C | Mean / median / mode imputation – a variable or observation is excluded if the proportion of missing data exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., &gt; 50 %). |
| D | k‑nearest neighbors (k‑NN) imputation – missing values are replaced using simple rules based on central tendency (single imputation). |
| E | Multiple imputation methods (if reported, specify algorithm and number of datasets *m* in comment) – missing values are imputed by identifying the *k* nearest observations and aggregating their values (e.g., mean, median, majority vote). |
| Y | Other – any missing‑data handling described in the excerpt that does **not** correspond to A–E (e.g., predictive mean matching with multiple datasets). |
| Z | None of the above categories are mentioned. |

**Step‑by‑Step Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify every explicit statement** about how missing data were handled.  
   - Only consider information that appears **in the excerpt itself**.  
   - Do **not** consult supplementary files, code, or external sources **unless** the excerpt explicitly says “see Supplementary Material …” and provides the needed detail.  
3. **Match each identified statement** to the exact wording of one of the categories A–E.  
   - If the wording matches a category, include its letter.  
   - If the statement describes a method that does not fit any of A–E, include `Y`.  
   - If multiple distinct methods are described, include **all** corresponding letters.  
4. **If the excerpt contains no information** about missing‑data handling, output `Z`.  
5. **Do not infer, guess, or extrapolate** beyond what is explicitly written.  
6. **Do not add any explanation, commentary, or whitespace** to the answer.  

**Handling Edge Cases**  

- **Ambiguous phrasing:** If the excerpt is vague such that you cannot confidently assign it to any category, treat it as “no information” and output `Z`.  
- **Partial information:** If only part of a method is described (e.g., “we imputed missing values”) but the specific technique is not stated, treat this as “Other” → include `Y`.  
- **Multiple mentions of the same method:** List the corresponding letter only once.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. From the supplied excerpt of a research paper, you must assign a single code that describes how data‑preparation steps were applied to the training and test sets.

**Target Variable**  
*Data‑preparation steps performed to train/test set separately*  

**Coding Rules**  

| Code | Meaning | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **0** | *Not reported* – the paper does **not** state whether any preparation step was done jointly or separately. | No explicit statement about joint or separate processing. |
| **1** | *Jointly* – the paper clearly says that at least one preparation step (e.g., mean imputation, scaling) was applied **to both the training and test data together**. | Explicit wording such as “the same imputation was applied to training and test sets” or “joint preprocessing”. |
| **2** | *Separately* – the paper explicitly states that preparation steps were carried out **independently for the training set and the test set**. | Explicit wording such as “training data were normalized separately from the test data”. |
| **-99** | *Not applicable* – the study has **no validation split** (e.g., “no validation”, “internal validation only”, “no train‑test split”). | Look for statements indicating that a train‑test split was never created. |
| **Z** | *Information missing* – the excerpt provides **no information** about how data‑preparation was performed **and** none of the above conditions apply. | If you cannot find any relevant statement, answer Z. |

**Important Restrictions**  

1. **Select **exactly one** code.**  
2. **Do not infer or guess.** Only use information that is *explicitly* stated in the excerpt.  
3. **Do not use the order or chronology of described methods as evidence of joint processing**; the text must clearly mention joint application.  
4. **If the excerpt mentions both joint and separate steps**, treat the variable as **jointly (code 1)**, because any joint step overrides the “separately” condition.  
5. **If the excerpt contains contradictory statements**, choose the code that matches the *clearest* explicit claim.  

**Output Format**  

- Return **only** the chosen code (e.g., `1`, `2`, `0`, `-99`, or `Z`).  
- No additional text, symbols, or explanations are allowed.  

**Reasoning (optional, for your own checking only)**  

- Scan the excerpt for keywords: “jointly”, “together”, “combined”, “same imputation”, etc. → code 1.  
- Scan for keywords: “separately**, “independently”, “separate preprocessing”, etc. → code 2.  
- Look for any statement that a train‑test split does not exist → code -99.  
- If none of the above appear, answer **Z**.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑paper coding assistant. For each excerpt you will identify which machine‑learning algorithms are **actually used for the primary prediction task** and mark the corresponding letters from the list below.

**Input Provided**  
- **Target Variable** – “Applied ML algorithms for prediction”  
- **Excerpt** – the text between `Excerpt:` and `Answer:` (the placeholder `{context}` will be replaced with the real passage)  
- **Answer Options** – letters A‑U and Y, each with a precise definition (see the table at the end).

**Output Requirement**  
Return **only** the selected letters, in **uppercase**, separated by **commas** with **no spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
If **no algorithm from the list is mentioned** in the excerpt, output **`Z`**.  
If the excerpt mentions an algorithm **not listed** among the options, include the letter **`Y`** (the “Other” category) **in addition to any other applicable letters**.

**Step‑by‑Step Instructions**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify every algorithm that the authors explicitly state is used for the *prediction* (not just for feature selection, preprocessing, or exploratory analysis).**  
3. **Match each identified algorithm to the exact option letter** in the table.  
   - If an algorithm is described but does **not** appear in the table, select **`Y`** (“Other”).  
4. **If multiple algorithms satisfy the criteria, list all corresponding letters.**  
5. **If the excerpt contains no information about prediction algorithms, output `Z`.**  
6. **Do not infer, guess, or add any information that is not explicitly present in the excerpt.**  
7. **Do not provide explanations, justifications, or any extra text—only the final letter list (or `Z`).**

**Edge‑Case Handling**

- **Ambiguous wording** (e.g., “we tried several models” without naming them): treat as **no explicit information** → answer `Z`.  
- **Algorithm mentioned only for feature selection** (e.g., “LASSO was used to select variables”) → **do not** mark it unless the text also says it was the prediction model.  
- **Custom or ensemble methods** that are described in detail but not named in the list → include `Y`.  
- **Repeated mentions** of the same algorithm → list the letter only once.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper (the *Excerpt*) and determine which of the predefined answer categories best describes how the paper reports (or does not report) the hyperparameter values used for model tuning.

**Target Variable**  
*Hyperparameter values chosen for tuning*

**Answer Options (choose one or more letters, exactly as shown)**  

| Letter | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **A** | The excerpt states that hyperparameter values are **not mentioned** at all. |
| **B** | The authors use a **fixed set of hyperparameter values** (i.e., they do not tune but apply predefined values). |
| **C** | The authors say they used **default values**, but do **not specify** what those defaults are. |
| **D** | The authors provide a **specific list or range of hyperparameter values** (e.g., “grid = {0.1, 0.01, 0.001}”). |
| **E** | **Other** – the excerpt clearly indicates a correct answer that does not fit any of the above categories. |
| **Z** | **None of the above** – the excerpt contains **no information** about hyperparameter values (i.e., it is silent on the topic). |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the Excerpt carefully.** Base your answer **solely** on the information that is explicitly present in the excerpt. Do **not** infer, guess, or add any information that is not directly stated.  

2. **Select all applicable letters** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If the excerpt matches more than one category, list **every** matching letter, separated by commas and no spaces.  
   - If the excerpt matches exactly one category, return that single letter.  

3. **When to use each letter**  
   - **A** – The excerpt says nothing about hyperparameter values (e.g., “we do not discuss hyperparameters”).  
   - **B** – The excerpt explicitly mentions using a predetermined, unchanging set of values (e.g., “we fixed the learning rate at 0.01”).  
   - **C** – The excerpt states that default settings were used **without** listing them (e.g., “we used the software defaults”).  
   - **D** – The excerpt provides concrete values or a range that were considered or selected (e.g., “we tuned the regularization parameter over {0.1, 1, 10}”).  
   - **E** – The excerpt indicates a situation not covered by A‑D (e.g., “hyperparameters were optimized via a proprietary algorithm not described”).  
   - **Z** – The excerpt contains **no** mention of hyperparameters **and** none of the above categories apply.  

4. **Missing or ambiguous information**  
   - If the excerpt suggests a modeling decision (e.g., mentions a software package) but does **not** explicitly state the hyperparameter values, treat this as **missing** and select **A** (or **Z** if the excerpt is completely silent).  
   - If the wording is ambiguous and does not clearly satisfy any category, default to **Z**.  

5. **Output format**  
   - Return **only** the selected letter(s) as a plain string (e.g., `A`, `B,D`, `E`).  
   - Do **not** include explanations, additional text, or punctuation beyond the letters and commas.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with classifying a paper excerpt according to a fixed coding scheme for the variable **“Method chosen for hyper‑parameter tuning”**.

**Context**  
You will be given the excerpt (the variable *Excerpt*). The coding scheme and answer options are listed below.

**Answer Options**  

| Letter | Meaning |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | “Tuning method not specified, stated that default method was used.” |
| **B** | “Random search – the authors do not specify the tuning method and state only that the default procedure of the software was used.” |
| **C** | “Grid search – all possible combinations of predefined hyper‑parameter values are systematically evaluated.” |
| **D** | “Model‑based optimization – a surrogate model is built and iteratively updated to predict performance and prioritize promising configurations.” |
| **E** | “Optimization heuristics – rule‑based strategies iteratively searching for combinations of hyper‑parameters.” |
| **F** | “-99 = Not applicable (use only if the only answer selected in section 3.2 was ‘Fixed set of hyper‑parameter values’).” |
| **Y** | “Other – any tuning method described in the excerpt that does not match A‑E.” |
| **Z** | “None of the above – the excerpt contains no information about the tuning method.” |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Select every letter whose definition matches information that is **explicitly** stated in the excerpt.**  
   - If the excerpt mentions a method that is not covered by A‑E, select **Y** (Other).  
   - If the excerpt provides *no* information about the tuning method, select **Z** and **no other letters**.  
3. **Do not infer, guess, or add information that is not present verbatim in the excerpt.**  
4. **If multiple applicable letters exist, list them in alphabetical order, separated by commas (e.g., `A,C,E`).**  
5. **If the only appropriate answer is the special “not applicable” code, select **F** alone.**  
6. **Output only the selected letter(s).** Do **not** include explanations, reasoning, or any additional text.  

**Handling Edge Cases**  

- **Ambiguous wording** – If the excerpt could be interpreted in more than one way, choose the most specific option that is *clearly* supported; otherwise, default to **Z**.  
- **Partial information** – If the excerpt mentions only that a default method was used but does not name it, choose **A** (or **B** if the wording matches the Random‑search description).  
- **Contradictory statements** – Follow the statement that directly describes the tuning method; ignore any unrelated sentences.  

**Output Format**  

`&lt;letter&gt;` or `&lt;letter1&gt;,&lt;letter2&gt;,…` (no spaces, no punctuation other than commas).  

**Example**  

*Excerpt:* “We performed a grid search over learning‑rate and batch‑size.”  
*Answer:* `C`

<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify the excerpt from a research paper according to the predefined coding scheme for *Nested data structure*.

**Context:**  
You will be given a single excerpt (the *Excerpt*). Use only the information explicitly present in that excerpt.

**Instructions**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Select exactly one option** that best describes the nested‑data situation described for the **training sample** (ignore any information that refers only to validation or test samples).  
3. **Return only the selected code** (a single character) with **no additional text, spaces, or explanation**.  
   - If the excerpt clearly indicates **no nested structure**, output `0`.  
   - If the excerpt describes a **hierarchical** nesting (e.g., patients within clinics, students within schools), output `1`.  
   - If the excerpt describes a **longitudinal / repeated‑measures** design where each row is a time point nested within an individual (e.g., weekly ratings for each participant), output `2`.  
   - If the excerpt **does not contain any information** about a nested data structure for the training sample, output `Z`.  
4. **Do not infer** a nested structure from context clues alone. If the authors never mention nesting, even if the description *suggests* it, answer `Z`.  
5. **Do not consider** nested structures that apply only to validation or test data; they are irrelevant for this coding.  
6. **If the excerpt contains contradictory statements** (e.g., both hierarchical and longitudinal descriptions), choose the option that is **explicitly stated** and ignore the contradictory part. If both are explicitly stated, treat this as “information not present” and answer `Z`.  

**Optional Reasoning (for internal use only – do not output):**  
- Identify any sentence that mentions the sampling or data‑collection hierarchy.  
- Verify that the mentioned hierarchy pertains to the training data.  
- Map the identified hierarchy to the three answer categories.  

**Target Variable – Description:**  
The presence of a nested data structure is relevant **only for the sample used for model training**. Any nested‑data information limited to validation samples should be ignored.

**Answer Options**  
- `0` – No nested structure  
- `1` – Hierarchical (e.g., patients nested in clinics)

If the authors do not mention or discuss a nested data structure but the sample description and data collection context suggest one, this should be noted accordingly. 
Answer Options: 0: No nested structure
1: Hierarchical - For example, patients nested in clinics.
2: Longitudinal / repeated measures - Each row represents a timepoint nested within an observation in long format / row-per-timepoint (e.g., weekly stress ratings and mood scores for each participant over 10 weeks), with time-varying predictors and outcomes.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with labeling a given excerpt from a research paper. Using only the information that **explicitly appears in the excerpt**, select the appropriate code(s) from the list below.

**How to respond**  
- Return **only** the chosen letter(s).  
- If more than one code applies, list the letters **in alphabetical order**, separated by commas **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If the excerpt contains a correct answer that is **not represented** by any of the listed codes, select the code for **“Other”**.  
- If **no relevant information** for the target variable is present, output **`Z`**.  
- **Never** add explanations, comments, or any text other than the required letter(s).  

**Handling special cases**  
- **Missing or empty excerpt:** treat as “no relevant information” → output `Z`.  
- **Ambiguous or partially stated information:** only select a code if the excerpt **clearly and unambiguously** matches the definition of that code. Do not infer or guess.  
- **Multiple applicable codes:** include **all** that satisfy the definitions, following the ordering rule above.  

**Target Variable**  
*Handling of nested data structures*  

**Answer Options**  

- **A** – Rationale why nested handling is not necessary.  
- **B** – Grouped / nested cross‑validation (CV).  
- **C** – Time‑series CV that respects group structure (e.g., leave‑group‑out CV), ensuring all observations from a group (such as patients of the same therapist) are kept together in either the training or test fold.  
- **D** – Mixed‑effects machine‑learning algorithms (e.g., rolling/expanding‑window CV, blocked CV).  
- **E** – **Other** (e.g., applying regularized linear mixed‑effect models such as `lmmlasso`).  
- **F** – `-99` = Not applicable (used only when the questionnaire item 3.4 equals 0).  
- **Z** – None of the above codes apply (no relevant information in the excerpt).

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and **select every answer letter that correctly describes how the paper handles class imbalance**, according to the coding scheme provided.

**Context**  
- **Excerpt:** `{context}` (the exact text you will analyze)  
- **Target Variable:** *Handling of class imbalance*  

**Answer Options (choose any that apply):**  
- **A:** “Up / down / SMOTE / otherwise sampling on full data”  
- **B:** “Up / down / SMOTE / otherwise sampling after split”  
- **C:** “Adapting decision rules”  
- **D:** “‑99 = Not applicable (if 4 in 1.8) – For example, training for sensitivity or changing the .50 cutoff.”  
- **E:** **Other** – use this letter only when the excerpt states a correct handling method that is **not** captured by A‑D.  

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Base your decision **solely** on the information explicitly present in the excerpt. Do **not** infer, guess, or add any information that is not stated.  

2. **Select all letters that apply:**  
   - If the excerpt matches one or more of the definitions in A‑D, list each corresponding letter.  
   - If the excerpt mentions a handling method that does **not** fit any of A‑D, select **E (Other)** *in addition to* any other applicable letters.  
   - If the excerpt contains **no information** about class‑imbalance handling, output only **Z**.  

3. **Formatting of the answer:**  
   - List the selected letters in **uppercase**, separated by commas **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If the answer is `Z`, output exactly `Z`.  

4. **Edge‑case handling:**  
   - **Ambiguous or partial statements** (e.g., “we used sampling” without specifying when) should be treated as **insufficient**; do **not** select any option unless the statement matches a definition unambiguously.  
   - **Multiple correct methods** described in the excerpt must all be included.  
   - **“Other”** should only be used when the excerpt clearly states a method that is **not** covered by A‑D. Do not use “Other” for vague or unspecified methods.  

5. **Optional reasoning (do not include in the final answer):**  
   - If you are unsure, review the excerpt again to locate exact phrasing that matches an option.  
   - If no match is found after a second review, default to `Z`.  

**Output**  
Provide **only** the answer letters as described above. No explanations, no additional text.  

**Example**  
- Excerpt states: “We applied SMOTE after splitting the data.” → `B`  
- Excerpt states: “We used a custom cost‑sensitive loss and also applied SMOTE on the full dataset.” → `A,E`

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with **coding** a short excerpt from a research paper. The excerpt must be classified according to the **pre‑defined coding scheme** below.  

**Output Requirement**  
Return **only** the capital letters that correspond to the applicable codes, separated by commas and **no other text** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
If the excerpt contains **no information that matches any code**, output the single letter `Z`.  
If the excerpt **clearly states a correct answer that is not represented by any of the listed codes**, also include the code `O` (for “Other”).  

**Coding Scheme**  

| Code | Description (apply only when the excerpt explicitly states this) |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | Comparison **between a naïve guessing model and any ML model**. The focus is on **predictive performance only**; comparisons based on variable importance or feature selection do **not** count. |
| **B** | Comparison **between an unregularized linear/logistic regression model and a simple regularized linear/logistic model or a complex ML model**. Also includes **comparisons among different simple regularized linear/logistic ML models**. |
| **C** | Comparison **between a simple regularized linear/logistic model and a complex ML model** *or* between a **ML model and a naïve baseline** (e.g., always predicts the majority class, random guessing, or a rule based on theory or a very small variable set). |
| **D** | Comparison **among different complex ML models**. (Note: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic‑Net are *not* complex; they belong to the “simple regularized” group and therefore do **not** trigger D.) |
| **O** | “Other” – the excerpt indicates a valid model‑comparison that does **not** fit any of the definitions above. |
| **Z** | None of the above codes apply (the excerpt provides no relevant comparison). |

**Step‑by‑Step Procedure**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (provided in the placeholder `{context}`) **very carefully**.  
2. Identify **explicit statements** about model comparisons. Implicit or inferred comparisons are **not** allowed.  
3. Match each explicit statement to **one (or more) of the codes A–D** according to the exact definitions above.  
4. If a statement matches **none** of A–D but still represents a legitimate model comparison, add **O**.  
5. If **no** statements match any code, output **Z**.  
6. **Do not** add explanations, reasoning, or any characters other than the required letters and commas.  

**Handling Edge Cases**  

- **Multiple applicable codes**: List **all** that apply, in alphabetical order, separated by commas (e.g., `A,B,D`).  
- **Ambiguous wording**: If the excerpt is ambiguous enough that you cannot determine with certainty which code applies, treat it as **no applicable code** and output **Z**.  
- **Missing information**: If the excerpt does not mention any model comparison, output **Z**.  
- **Contradictory statements**: Follow the **first explicit, unambiguous** comparison that appears; ignore contradictory later sentences unless they introduce an additional, clearly distinct comparison.

<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify the information in the given research‑paper excerpt according to the coding scheme below.

**Instructions (follow exactly):**

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text that appears after the line `Excerpt:`).  
2. **Determine the “Best performing model”** as described in the *Target Variable* section.  
3. **Select ONE code** that best matches the excerpt.  
4. **Output ONLY the chosen code** (e.g., `1`, `99`, or `Z`). Do **not** add explanations, symbols, or any other text.

**Handling missing or ambiguous information**

- If the excerpt contains **no statement** about which algorithm/model is best, output `Z`.  
- If the excerpt **explicitly states that more than one algorithm is considered best** (i.e., the authors say no single algorithm outperforms the others), output `1`.  
- If the excerpt **identifies a specific algorithm as the best** **and** this identification is consistent with the reported performance numbers, output the **numeric code for that algorithm** (see the “Answer Options” table).  
- If the excerpt **identifies a specific algorithm as the best** **but the reported numbers contradict that claim**, output `99` and **add a comment** after the number in the following format (still a single line):  

  ```
  99: &lt;algorithm name&gt;

| **1** | No algorithm outperforms others – authors state that several (or all) algorithms perform equally well. |
| **99**| Authors name a best‑performing algorithm **that contradicts** the reported performance figures. *(Include the algorithm name as a comment, see above.)* |
| **Z** | The excerpt does **not** contain any information about a best‑performing algorithm. |
| **2‑98** | (If the authors explicitly name a best‑performing algorithm and the claim is consistent with the data, use the numeric code that corresponds to that algorithm as provided in the coding sheet you are using.) |

**Optional reasoning (you may perform this internally, but do not output it):**  

- Identify any performance tables or statements of superiority.  
- Verify whether the named algorithm actually has the highest reported metric.  
- Apply the rules above to select the appropriate code.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper (the *Excerpt*) and assign the appropriate code‑letter(s) that describe how the study performed model validation, using the coding scheme provided below.

**Coding Scheme (choose the letter(s) that apply)**  

| Letter | Meaning |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | No validation |
| **B** | Internal validation, **no** data split (e.g., validation on the same data used for training) |
| **C** | Internal validation, **single split** – performance is evaluated only on the training data (no separate validation set) |
| **D** | Internal validation, **repeated splits** (nested resampling, cross‑validation) – only training data are used, no independent hold‑out set |
| **E** | External validation, **single independent hold‑out** from the same population (e.g., one 80/20 train‑test split) |
| **F** | External validation, **multiple independent hold‑outs** from a *different* population (more than one outer‑loop train‑test split) |
| **Other** | The excerpt states a validation approach that is **not** captured by any of the letters above. |
| **Z** | The excerpt contains **no information** about model validation (i.e., validation is not mentioned at all). |

**Output Format**  
- Return **only** the selected letter(s) separated by commas, **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If the correct answer is “Other”, include the literal word **Other** as a separate entry (e.g., `Other`).  
- If none of the above letters apply because the excerpt gives no validation information, output **Z**.  
- **Do not** add explanations, comments, or any additional text.

**Procedural Rules**  

1. **Strict Source Fidelity** – Base your decision **exclusively** on the information present in the excerpt. Do not infer, guess, or use external knowledge.  
2. **Multiple Applicable Codes** – If the excerpt clearly describes more than one validation method that matches different letters, list **all** applicable letters (e.g., `B,D`).  
3. **Missing or Ambiguous Information** –  
   - If the excerpt mentions validation but the description is vague enough that it cannot be confidently matched to any single letter, select **Other**.  
   - If the excerpt does not mention validation at all, select **Z**.  
4. **Edge Cases** –  
   - If the excerpt states that validation was performed but does not specify whether the hold‑out data come from the same or a different population, treat it as **Other** (the population detail is required for letters E vs. F).  
   - If the excerpt describes a method that combines internal and external validation (e.g., cross‑validation *and* an external test set), list **all** matching letters (e.g., `D,E`).  
5. **“Other” Handling** – When you select **Other**, do **not** pair it with any other letters unless the excerpt also clearly matches another code.  

**Example**  

- **Excerpt:** “We performed 5‑fold cross‑validation on the training set and then evaluated the final model on an independent test set drawn from a different hospital.”  
- **Correct Answer:** `D,F` (because both internal repeated splits and external validation on a different population are described).  

**Now, classify the following excerpt:**

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:**  
Classify the information in the given research‑paper excerpt according to the coding scheme below.

**Target Variable:** Performance metrics reported for the training set  
**Description:** Whether the excerpt explicitly states any performance metric (e.g., accuracy, loss, F1‑score, AUC, etc.) that was calculated on the **training** data.

**Answer Options**  
1 – No (the excerpt does **not** mention any training‑set performance metric)  
2 – Yes (the excerpt **does** mention at least one training‑set performance metric)  

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. Determine whether the excerpt contains a **direct statement** of a performance metric *specifically for the training set*.  
   - Do **not** count metrics reported only for validation, test, or other data splits.  
   - Do **not** infer or assume a metric when it is not explicitly mentioned.  
3. **Select exactly one number** (1 or 2) that best reflects the presence or absence of such information.  
4. If the excerpt provides **no information** about training‑set performance metrics, output **`Z`**.  
5. **Output format:** Return **only** the selected character (`1`, `2`, or `Z`) with no surrounding text, punctuation, or explanation.  

**Edge‑case handling**  

- *Ambiguous phrasing* (e.g., “the model performed well”) → treat as **no** information → answer `1`.  
- *Mention of a metric without specifying the data split* → treat as **no** information → answer `1`.  
- *Multiple metrics* → if at least one is explicitly tied to the training set, answer `2`.  

**Optional reasoning (for internal use only, not to be included in the final answer):**  
Briefly note whether a training‑set metric was found and which term indicated it (e.g., “training accuracy = 92%”). This reasoning should be discarded before submitting the final output.

- Return **only** the extracted number **exactly as it appears in the excerpt** (do not add commas, units, rounding, or any other characters).  
- If the excerpt does **not** explicitly report a numeric value for the target concept, or if the value is ambiguous, answer with the single character **`Z`**.  
- No additional text, explanation, symbols, or formatting is allowed.

**Handling Edge Cases &amp; Missing Information**  
1. **Multiple candidates:** If more than one number could plausibly be the highest test‑sample performance, choose the one that is *clearly* identified as the highest (e.g., “the best accuracy was 92.3 %” or “maximum F1‑score = 0.78”). If the excerpt does not make a clear distinction, reply with `Z`.  
2. **Ranges or intervals:** If performance is given as a range (e.g., “between 85 % and 90 %”), treat this as ambiguous and answer `Z`.  
3. **Derived values:** Do **not** compute or infer values (e.g., averaging, converting percentages to decimals). Use only the exact number presented.  
4. **Missing or non‑numeric descriptors:** If the excerpt mentions “the highest performance was not reported” or uses words only, answer `Z`.  
5. **Formatting quirks:** Accept numbers with decimal points, commas as thousands separators, or scientific notation, but return them exactly as written (e.g., `1,234.56` stays `1,234.56`).  

**Procedure** (optional reasoning for you, not to be output):  
- Scan the excerpt for any sentence that includes the phrase “highest,” “maximum,” “best,” “peak,” or similar qualifiers referring to performance on the test sample.  
- Verify that the associated value is a numeric token (digits, optional decimal point, optional commas, optional exponent).  
- Confirm that the value is not part of a range, comparison, or a derived statement.  
- Output that number; otherwise output `Z`.

You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and decide whether the excerpt *explicitly* reports confidence intervals for any performance metric.

**What you must output**  
- Return **exactly one token**:  
  - `1` if the excerpt states that **no** confidence intervals are provided.  
  - `2` if the excerpt states that confidence intervals **are** provided.  
  - `Z` if the excerpt does **not contain any information** about confidence intervals (i.e., the topic is not mentioned, is only implied, or is ambiguous).  

Do **not** include any additional characters, spaces, explanations, or formatting.

Description:   (the variable being assessed)
Answer Options:
  1: No
  2: Yes
Excerpt:
{context}
```

- `{context}` will be replaced with the actual paper excerpt.

---

### Decision Rules

1. **Exact statement required** – The excerpt must contain a clear, explicit statement about confidence intervals. Anything less (e.g., “we report variability”, “results are robust”, or a reference to a figure without a textual description) does **not** count as evidence.
2. **Positive detection** – If the text says *any* of the following (or synonyms):
   - “confidence interval(s) …”
   - “95 % CI”, “90 % CI”, etc.
   - “error bars represent confidence intervals”
   - “the performance metric is reported with a confidence interval”
   then answer `2`.
3. **Negative detection** – If the text explicitly says that confidence intervals are **not** provided, e.g.:
   - “no confidence intervals were calculated”
   - “confidence intervals are omitted”
   - “we do not report confidence intervals”
   then answer `1`.
4. **Missing or ambiguous** – If the excerpt contains no mention of confidence intervals, or the mention is vague/implicit (e.g., “results are shown with error bars” without specifying they are confidence intervals), answer `Z`.
5. **Conflicting statements** – If both a positive and a negative statement appear, prioritize the **positive** (i.e., answer `2`). If the conflict cannot be resolved, default to `Z`.

---

### Optional Reasoning (do **not** output)

If you need to improve accuracy, you may internally follow these steps before producing the final token:

1. Scan the excerpt for the exact phrase “confidence interval” or common abbreviations (“CI”, “95 % CI”, etc.).
2. Verify whether the phrase is qualified as **present** or **absent**.
3. Check for any explicit negation (“no”, “not”, “omit”, “absent”) directly attached to the phrase.
4. Apply the decision rules above.

Remember: **Only the final token (`1`, `2`, or `Z`) is to be returned.**</pre></td>

1. **Target Variable:** *Significance test(s)*  
2. **Description:** *(brief description of the variable – may be empty)*  
3. **Answer Options:**  
   - **A:** For model comparisons  
   - **B:** For variable importance measures

   - **Z:** No relevant information is present in the excerpt  

4. **Excerpt:** `{context}` – the exact text you must base your decision on.  

**Output Requirement**  
Return **only** the selected letter(s) in a single line, following these rules:

| Situation | What to output | Details |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| One or more options (A‑C) are *clearly* indicated in the excerpt | List all applicable letters, **alphabetically**, separated by commas (e.g., `A,C`) | Do not include spaces unless separating letters (e.g., `A, C` is acceptable). |
| The excerpt states a correct answer that does **not** match A‑C | Output the letter `Other` (exact spelling, case‑sensitive) | If other options coexist with A‑C, include `Other` together with the applicable letters (e.g., `A,Other`). |
| No information in the excerpt pertains to the target variable | Output `Z` | This is the only output in this case. |
| The excerpt is ambiguous or contradictory **and** does not allow a confident selection of any option | Output `Z` | Do not guess; choose `Z` when certainty is lacking. |
| Multiple letters apply | Include **all** applicable letters, sorted alphabetically, separated by commas. | Example: `A,B,Other`. |

**General Rules**  

- **Strict adherence:** Base your decision **only** on the text in the excerpt. Do not infer, extrapolate, or use external knowledge.  
- **No reasoning or commentary:** Do **not** add explanations, just the letter(s).  
- **No extra characters:** Do not include quotation marks, brackets, or any other symbols besides the letters and commas described above.  
- **Case sensitivity:** Use exactly the letters shown (`A`, `B`, `C`, `Other`, `Z`).

<td><pre>**Task**  
You are a research‑assistant whose sole job is to map the content of a given research‑paper excerpt to a predefined list of interpretable‑machine‑learning (IML) methods.

**Context**  
Excerpt (the text you must analyze) will be supplied after the line `Excerpt:` and before the line `Answer:`.

**Target Variable**  
“Interpretable machine learning (IML) methods applied”

**Answer Options (choose one or more letters)**  

| Letter | Method |
|--------|--------|
| A | (Standardized) Model Coefficients |
| B | Permutation Importance (Mean Decrease in Accuracy) |
| C | Gini Importance (Mean Decrease in Impurity for tree models) |
| D | H‑Statistic (for interaction strength) |
| E | SHAP Values |
| F | LIME (Local Interpretable Model‑agnostic Explanations) |
| G | Counterfactual Explanations |
| H | Scoped rules / anchors |
| I | Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) |
| J | Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) |
| K | Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) |
| L | Unspecified variable‑importance measures |
| Y | **Other** – the excerpt mentions an IML method that is **not** listed above |
| Z | **None** – the excerpt contains no information about any of the methods above |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify every IML method that is explicitly mentioned** in the excerpt.  
   - *Explicit* means the method name or a commonly‑used exact synonym appears in the text (e.g., “SHAP values”, “Permutation importance”).  
   - Do **not** infer a method from vague or indirect language; if the mention is ambiguous, treat it as not present.  
3. **Select all applicable letters**:  
   - For each identified method that matches one of the options A–L, include its letter.  
   - If the excerpt mentions a method that is **not** in the list, include **Y** (Other).  
   - If the excerpt contains **no** method from A–L **and** does not mention any other method, output **Z**.  
4. **Output format**:  
   - Return a **single line** containing only the chosen letters, separated by commas **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
   - If only one letter applies, output that single letter (e.g., `F`).  
   - If the correct answer is “None”, output exactly `Z`.  
5. **Do not add any explanation, commentary, or additional text.**  
6. **Do not guess**; if the excerpt does not provide a clear, explicit mention, default to “None” (`Z`).  

**Example**

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with **identifying and coding limitations** that are explicitly mentioned in the *discussion* section of a research‑paper excerpt.

**Input Elements**  

- **Target Variable** – *Limitations mentioned in the discussion*  
- **Excerpt** – The text provided inside the placeholder `{context}` (this is the only source you may use).  
- **Answer Options** – The list of codes below.  

**Answer Options (choose one or more letters, exactly as shown)**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| A | Lack of representativeness of the data |
| B | Unreliably measured indicators |
| C | Unreliably measured outcome |
| D | Incomplete data |
| E | Sample size |
| F | Unfavorable n/p ratio |
| G | Mono‑method data types (e.g., exclusively relying on rating / judgement data) |
| H | Caution in interpretation of interpretable ML techniques |
| I | High computational demands of ML |
| J | Model fairness / alignment |
| Y | Other (any limitation that is **clearly** stated but does not fit any of the codes A–J) |
| Z | No limitation is present in the excerpt (or the excerpt does not contain a discussion section) |

**Output Format**  

- Return **only** the selected letter(s).  
- If more than one code applies, list them **in alphabetical order**, separated by commas **without spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  
- If no code applies, output the single letter `Z`.  
- Do **not** include any explanation, commentary, or additional characters.

**Step‑by‑Step Instructions**  

1. **Locate the discussion section** within the provided excerpt.  
2. **Extract every limitation** that is *explicitly* stated (no inference, no reading between the lines).  
3. For each extracted limitation:  
   - Match it to the *exact* meaning of one of the codes A–J.  
   - If the limitation does **not** correspond to any of A–J but is clearly expressed, select code **Y**.  
   - If a limitation could plausibly belong to more than one code, choose the **most specific** code; do **not** select multiple codes for the same statement.  
4. **Compile all selected codes** (including Y if needed).  
5. If the excerpt contains **no explicit limitation** or does not contain a discussion section at all, output **Z**.  
6. If any limitation is **ambiguous** (you cannot determine with certainty which code applies), treat it as **not present** and output **Z** (do not guess).  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- **Missing discussion section** → output `Z`.  
- **No limitation mentioned** → output `Z`.  
- **Limitation described but vague** (e.g., “the results should be interpreted cautiously” without linking to a specific code) → output `Z`.  
- **Multiple distinct limitations** → list all applicable codes.  
- **Exact duplicate limitation** (same wording) → count only once.  

**Do Not**  

- Infer limitations that are not directly stated.  
- Add any text beyond the required letter(s).  
- Use spaces, line breaks, or punctuation other than commas between letters.  

**Example**  

```

<td><pre>**Task**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code that best describes how the authors handle model‑comparison interpretation, according to the coding scheme below.

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Select the single number** that matches the description of the authors’ approach.  
3. **Return ONLY that number** (e.g., `1`, `2`, or `-99`). Do **not** add any explanation, punctuation, or extra characters.  
4. **If the excerpt does not contain any information about model‑comparison interpretation**, output the special token `Z`.  
5. **Do not guess, infer, or add information** that is not explicitly stated in the excerpt.  
6. **If multiple answer options appear to apply**, choose the one that most closely matches the primary focus of the excerpt.  
7. **Edge‑case handling**:  
   - If the excerpt mentions a model comparison but only describes the results without any interpretation, choose option **1**.  
   - If the excerpt provides an explicit interpretation of why one model outperforms another (e.g., linking performance to data characteristics), choose option **2**.  
   - If the coding scheme is declared “Not applicable” for this item (e.g., the paper indicates the variable is irrelevant), use **-99**.  
   - If the excerpt is empty, unreadable, or completely unrelated to model comparison, use `Z`.  

**Target Variable**  
*Interpretation of model comparison*

**Coding Scheme**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **1** | **No comparisons / descriptive comparisons only** – The authors mention or show model performance numbers but give no explanatory interpretation, or they do not perform a model comparison at all. |
| **2** | **Interpretative comparisons** – The authors draw conclusions about relationships, data structure, or underlying mechanisms based on the model comparison (e.g., attributing superior performance of a random forest over an elastic net to interaction effects). |
| **-99** | **Not applicable** – Use only when the original questionnaire indicates this item is not applicable (e.g., “if 0 in 4.1”). |
| **Z** | **Information missing** – The excerpt does not contain any statement about model‑comparison interpretation. |

<td><pre>Example 1:
Extract from paper: In our experiments we evaluated three classifiers: a logistic regression, a support vector machine, and a gradient boosting tree. The logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 78%, the SVM 81%, and the gradient boosting tree 84% on the held‑out test set. These results are summarized in Table 2. 
True Answer: 1
Example 2:
Extract from paper: The random forest outperformed the elastic net (accuracy 87% vs. 78%). This suggests that the underlying data contain strong interaction effects that the tree‑based model can capture, whereas the linear elastic net, which assumes additive relationships, cannot. Consequently, we infer that feature interactions play a critical role in predicting the outcome.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant tasked with classifying a single excerpt from a scholarly paper. The classification must follow a predefined coding scheme that captures how the authors discuss the *generalizability of model performance and variable‑importance measures*.

**Input Provided**  
- **Excerpt** – the exact passage from the paper (enclosed in `{context}` below).  
- **Target Variable** – “Generalizability of model performance and variable importance measures”.  
- **Answer Options** – a numbered list (0‑2) with a special “missing” code **Z**.

**Classification Rules**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Use **only** the information that appears in the excerpt; do **not** rely on external knowledge, assumptions, or inference.  

2. **Select exactly one code** that best describes the authors’ statements about generalizability:  

| Code | Meaning (must match the excerpt verbatim) |
|------|-------------------------------------------|
| **0** | The excerpt contains **no** statement about generalizability. |
| **1** | The authors **claim** that their model (or variable‑importance results) **generalizes** to populations, settings, or contexts **outside** the sampled data frame (e.g., “our model trained on U.S. data generalizes across cultures”). |
| **2** | The authors **limit** their claim to the data analyzed **or explicitly question** generalizability beyond the sampling frame (e.g., “results from this region may not apply elsewhere”). |
| **Z** | The excerpt **does not provide any information** on the target variable (the passage is unrelated, empty, or the relevant information is omitted). |

3. **Edge‑Case Handling**  

   - If the excerpt contains **both** a claim of broad generalizability (code 1) **and** a simultaneous qualification that limits it (code 2), choose the **more inclusive** code (**1**).  
   - If the excerpt includes **multiple separate statements** that fall into different categories, select the code that **best represents the overall stance** (again, the most inclusive applicable code).  
   - If the wording is **ambiguous** and cannot be confidently assigned to 0, 1, or 2, treat it as **missing information** and answer **Z**.  

4. **Output Format**  

   - Return **only** the chosen code (0, 1, 2, or Z).  
   - Do **not** include explanations, punctuation, whitespace, or any additional characters.  

**Optional Reasoning (for internal use only)**  
If you wish to improve accuracy, you may first write a brief note (in your own mind) summarizing the relevant sentence(s) and the reason for your chosen code, then delete it before submitting the final answer. The model’s final response must contain **only** the single code.
