<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign it a single code from a predefined coding scheme. The assignment must be made *only* on information that is explicitly present in the excerpt.

**Coding Scheme**  
- **1** – “No” (the excerpt indicates that the target variable does **not** apply)  
- **2** – “Yes” (the excerpt indicates that the target variable **does** apply)  
- **Z** – “Not mentioned” (the excerpt provides no information that allows you to determine a Yes or No)

**Target Variable**  
- **Open code** – *[Insert brief description of what “Open code” means, if needed. If the description is intentionally left blank, keep it blank.]*  

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully** (the text appears after the line `Excerpt:`).  
2. **Identify whether the excerpt explicitly states** that the target variable **applies** (Yes) or **does not apply** (No).  
   - *Do not infer, guess, or rely on external knowledge.*  
   - *Do not consider implicit or ambiguous statements; the information must be unambiguous and directly stated.*  
3. **Select exactly one response**:  
   - `1` if the excerpt clearly says the target variable does **not** apply.  
   - `2` if the excerpt clearly says the target variable **does** apply.  
   - `Z` if the excerpt provides **no** information that allows you to determine a Yes or No.  
4. **Output format**:  
   - Return **only** the single character (`1`, `2`, or `Z`).  
   - Do **not** include any explanation, punctuation, or additional text.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- **Multiple statements**: If the excerpt contains both a clear “Yes” and a clear “No” for the same target, treat this as contradictory; in such a case, default to `Z` because the required information is ambiguous.  
- **Partial or vague statements** (e.g., “might be open”, “could involve”, “suggests openness”): Treat these as **not sufficient** evidence; answer `Z`.  
- **References to other sections** (e.g., “see Table 3”) without the actual content: Treat as missing information; answer `Z`.  

**Reasoning (optional, for internal verification only)**  
- Before responding, you may mentally note the exact sentence(s) that support your choice, but do **not** include this reasoning in the final answer.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract a single numeric value (or a placeholder) from the supplied research‑paper excerpt.

**Context:**  
The excerpt below is the only source you may use.

```
{context}
```

**Target Variable:**  
*Programming language used for ML‑related computations in the study (as reported in the article).*

**Extraction Rules**

1. **Exact Match Required**  
   - Return **the exact numeric identifier** that appears in the document for the target variable.  
   - If the document lists a programming language **as a number** (e.g., “Language = 2” where 2 = Python), output that number **exactly**.

2. **Deriving the Language from Packages**  
   - If the excerpt does **not** state a numeric code but mentions a **package that is uniquely tied to a single programming language** (e.g., “TensorFlow”, “PyTorch” → Python; “caret”, “mlr” → R), you must **record the numeric code that the dataset schema assigns to that language**.  
   - The mapping from language to numeric code will be provided elsewhere; **do not guess** the code—if you do not know the mapping, treat the information as unavailable and answer “Z”.

3. **Missing or Ambiguous Information**  
   - If the excerpt provides **no numeric value**, no uniquely identifying package, or the language cannot be unambiguously linked to a single language, answer **`Z`**.  
   - Do **not** infer, estimate, or create a value.

4. **Output Format**  
   - **Only** output a single token: the numeric value **or** the capital letter **`Z`**.  
   - No punctuation, units, explanations, or additional text is allowed.

5. **Optional Reasoning (for internal use only)**  
   - You may briefly note (in your own “thought” process) why a value was chosen or why `Z` was returned, but this reasoning must **not** appear in the final answer.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research assistant. From the excerpt below you must decide whether the authors *explicitly* report the exact version of the programming language they used (e.g., “Python 3.9”, “R 4.2.1”).  

**Target Variable**  
*Programming language version reported*  

**Answer Options**  
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 1    | No – the excerpt mentions a programming language but does **not** give a specific version number. |
| 2    | Yes – the excerpt contains an explicit version statement for the programming language (e.g., “Python 3.9”, “R 4.2.1”). |
| Z    | Not present – the excerpt contains **no** mention of a programming language at all. |

**Instructions (strictly enforced)**  

1. **Read the excerpt** (provided in the placeholder `{context}`) **carefully**.  
2. **Select exactly one code** from the table above that best matches the excerpt.  
   - If a version is stated **exactly** (numeric version, major/minor, patch), choose **2**.  
   - If a language is mentioned **without** a version, choose **1**.  
   - If no language is mentioned, choose **Z**.  
3. **Do not** infer, guess, or extrapolate from indirect statements (e.g., “we used the latest Python” → treat as **1**).  
4. **Do not** output any explanation, reasoning, or additional characters—only the single code (`1`, `2`, or `Z`).  
5. If the excerpt is ambiguous (e.g., “Python 3” without a minor/patch number), treat it as an explicit version and output **2**.  
6. If multiple languages are listed, apply the rule to each; if **any** language includes a version, output **2**. If none include a version but languages are mentioned, output **1**.  

**Optional internal reasoning (do not include in the final answer)**  
- Scan for patterns like “<language> <major>.<minor>” or “<language> version <number>”.  
- Verify that the version is part of the authors’ methodological description, not a citation of another work.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the specific data requested from a research‑paper excerpt using the coding scheme below.  

**Context:**  
The excerpt will be supplied in the placeholder **{context}**.

**Target Variable:**  
*ML packages / libraries / modeling frameworks mentioned*  

**Output Requirements**

1. **Format** – Return **exactly one JSON array** containing the extracted items, in the order they appear in the excerpt.  
   - Example (when items are found): `["TensorFlow", "scikit‑learn", "PyTorch"]`  
   - Example (when no item is present): `["Z"]`

2. **Source fidelity** – Each array element must be **verbatim** (case‑preserving, spelling‑preserving) from the excerpt. Do **not** modify, truncate, or paraphrase the names.

3. **Missing information** – If the excerpt does **not** mention any ML package, library, or modeling framework, the array must contain a single element `"Z"` and nothing else.

4. **Ambiguity / Edge Cases**  
   - If a term could be interpreted as either a library or something else (e.g., “model”, “algorithm”, “framework” used generically), **exclude** it unless the excerpt explicitly names a concrete package/library/framework.  
   - If the same name appears multiple times, list it **once**, at its first occurrence.  
   - If a name is part of a longer phrase (e.g., “the TensorFlow‑Keras API”), extract the **core package name** only if it is clearly identified as a distinct package (e.g., “TensorFlow” and “Keras” would each be separate entries).

5. **No inference** – Do not guess, infer, or add items that are not explicitly present in the excerpt.

6. **No extra text** – Output only the JSON array; do not include explanations, headings, or any other characters.

**Procedure (optional reasoning for higher accuracy, not part of the output):**  
- Scan the excerpt line‑by‑line for capitalized terms that are commonly known ML packages (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit‑learn, Keras, MXNet, Caffe, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc.).  
- Verify each candidate appears as a **named entity** (not as part of a generic description).  
- Record the first occurrence of each verified name, preserving its exact spelling.  

**Now perform the extraction.**

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant whose sole job is to read the supplied excerpt and determine whether the authors explicitly report the version numbers of any machine‑learning‑related packages, libraries, or modelling frameworks (e.g., “scikit‑learn 1.2.2”, “caret 6.0‑93”, “mlr3 0.15.0”).

**Input Structure**  
- **Target Variable:** *Package / library / modeling framework version reported*  
- **Description:** *The authors provide the exact version numbers of the ML‑related software they used.*  
- **Answer Options:**  
  1️⃣ No – the excerpt contains no explicit version numbers.  
  2️⃣ Yes – the excerpt contains at least one explicit version number for a package, library, or framework.  
- **Excerpt:** The text you must examine is provided between the markers `{context}` and `Answer:`.

**Output Requirements**  
- Respond **with a single token only**: either `1`, `2`, or `Z`.  
  - `1` = No version numbers are present.  
  - `2` = At least one explicit version number is present.  
  - `Z` = The excerpt does **not** contain any information relevant to the target variable (e.g., the excerpt is missing, empty, or unrelated).  
- **Do not** add explanations, extra symbols, whitespace, or line breaks.  
- **Do not** guess or infer version numbers that are not stated verbatim in the excerpt.

**Handling Edge Cases**  
- If the excerpt mentions a package or library **without** a version (e.g., “we used scikit‑learn”), answer `1`.  
- If the excerpt lists a version but it is ambiguous or incomplete (e.g., “scikit‑learn v1”), treat this as **explicit** and answer `2`.  
- If multiple versions are listed, a single `2` is still the correct response.  
- If the excerpt is empty, corrupted, or does not address software at all, answer `Z`.  

**Optional Reasoning (for internal use only – do not output)**  
- Scan the excerpt for patterns matching `<name> <version>` or `<name> v<version>` where `<version>` follows typical numeric formatting (e.g., `1.2.3`, `6.0-93`).  
- Confirm that the version is directly attached to a ML‑related package, library, or framework.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code that best describes the accessibility of the data (the *Open data* variable) according to the coding scheme below.

**Input**  
- **Excerpt:** The text between the markers `Excerpt:` and `Answer:` (the variable `{context}` in the original prompt).  
- **Coding Scheme:** The list of numbered answer options provided below.

**Coding Scheme (choose one)**  

| Code | Meaning (must match the excerpt *exactly*) |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| **0** | *Not available* – The excerpt does not mention any original or pre‑processed data, or it states that the data cannot be accessed (e.g., private repository, broken link, otherwise inaccessible). |
| **1** | *Available upon request* – The excerpt says the data exist and can be obtained **only** by contacting the authors directly. |
| **2** | *Synthetic data only* – The excerpt indicates that only synthetic or simulated data are provided; no real/original data are available. |
| **3** | *Public repository (restricted or open)* – The data are deposited in a public repository, but access may require registration, a data‑use agreement, or other modest restrictions. |
| **4** | *Fully open access* – The data are freely downloadable (e.g., supplemental files or a direct repository link) with **no** restrictions. |
| **Z** | *Information missing* – The excerpt provides no information about data availability, or the information is too ambiguous to assign any of the codes above. |

**Selection Rules (apply in order)**

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
Extract the numeric value that represents the *sample size used for the final analysis* (i.e., the number of observations on which the model was trained and/or validated) from the excerpt below.

**Context**  
{context}

**Target Variable**  
*Sample size* – the total number of subjects, cases, or records that were included in the final dataset on which the model was built or evaluated.  
- If the paper mentions an initial hold‑out (e.g., “20 % of the data were set aside”) **and** a later external validation, report **the sample size of each distinct dataset** that was actually used for model training or validation, separated by a single comma in the order they appear in the text.  
- If only one dataset is described, report that single number.  

**Instructions**  

1. **Locate the value** that matches the definition above.  
2. **Report the value exactly as it appears** (do not round, convert units, or add commas/thousands separators).  
3. **If no such value is present, or the excerpt is ambiguous** (e.g., multiple possible numbers with no clear indication which is the final‑analysis size), answer **`Z`**.  
4. **Do not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or infer a number that is not explicitly stated.  
   - Provide units, symbols, explanations, or any additional text.  
   - Output anything other than the numeric value(s) or `Z`.  

**Output format**  

- Single numeric value → `12345`  
- Multiple numeric values (for multiple datasets) → `12345,67890` (comma‑separated, no spaces)  
- Missing/ambiguous → `Z`  

**Optional internal reasoning (you may use it to decide, but do not include it in the answer)**  
- Identify every number in the excerpt.  
- Determine which number(s) refer to the size of the dataset used for the final model training/validation according to the definition.  
- If the determination is clear, output as specified; otherwise output `Z`.

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract a single numeric value from the supplied excerpt that exactly matches the target variable.  

**Context (provided excerpt):**

**Target Variable:** Number of predictor variables used in the final analysis  

**What to return:**  
- The **exact numeric value** (digits only) that appears in the excerpt and represents the target variable.  
- If the excerpt **does not contain** a clear, unambiguous numeric value for this variable, output **only the letter `Z`** (uppercase).  

**Strict Rules (must be followed):**  

1. **Use the source text only.** Do **not** infer, estimate, or calculate a value that is not explicitly stated.  
2. **No additional text** – return **exactly** one of the following:  
   - A sequence of digits (e.g., `12`)  
   - The single character `Z`  
3. **Units, commas, or surrounding punctuation** must be omitted.  
4. If the number is presented as a **range**, **approximation**, or with qualifiers such as “about”, “≈”, “~”, treat it as **not reported** → answer `Z`.  
5. If the number is written **in words** (e.g., “ten”) or spelled out, treat it as **not reported** → answer `Z`.  
6. If **multiple numbers** appear, select the one that **clearly refers** to the count of predictor variables in the final analysis. If no such reference can be identified, answer `Z`.  
7. If the excerpt contains a phrase like “the final model included X predictor variables” or “X predictors were retained”, that X is the answer.  

**Optional Reasoning (do not output):**  
- Scan the excerpt for sentences that mention “predictor”, “variable”, “model”, “final analysis”, or similar keywords.  
- Verify that the numeric token directly follows or is explicitly linked to that keyword.

   - Example (missing): `Answer: Z`  
   - **Do not** include units, commas, explanatory text, or any other characters.  
5. **Handling multiple numbers** – If several numbers appear, select the one that clearly corresponds to the count of the minority class. If none can be unambiguously linked to that concept, answer `Z`.  
6. **Edge‑case handling** –  
   - If the excerpt mentions a percentage, proportion, or rate *instead* of a raw count, answer `Z`.  
   - If the excerpt gives a range or interval (e.g., “between 10 and 15 cases”), answer `Z`.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the required value from the supplied excerpt **exactly as it appears in the source document**.

**Context Structure**  
- **Target Variable:** Country of data acquisition  
- **Description:** Record the country where the data were collected.  
  - If the authors give only a city, state, province, or region, infer the corresponding country **only when the mapping is unambiguous** (e.g., “Paris” → France, “California” → United States).  
  - If the excerpt does not specify a country (or the location cannot be uniquely mapped), the answer must be **`Z`**.  

**Extraction Rules**  

1. **Locate the country name or its numeric code** (as presented in the excerpt).  
2. **If a city/state/region is given:**  
   - Convert it to the single, universally‑recognized country that contains it.  
   - Use the country name/code exactly as it would appear in a standard reference (e.g., “United States”, “USA”, “US”, “840”).  
   - **If more than one country could match** (e.g., “Georgia” the state vs. the country), treat the information as ambiguous → answer `Z`.  
3. **If multiple countries are listed** and it is unclear which one applies to the data acquisition, answer `Z`.  
4. **If the excerpt provides no location information**, answer **`Z`**.  
5. **Do not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or infer any value not directly supported by the text.  
   - Add units, comments, explanations, or any extra characters.  
   - Alter spelling or formatting of the country name/code.  

**Output Format**  
- A single token on its own line: either the exact country name/code **or** the capital letter **`Z`**.  
- No surrounding text, punctuation, or whitespace beyond the line break.

**Optional Reasoning (for internal use only)**  
If you wish, you may briefly note (in your own mind) why a value was chosen or why `Z` was returned, but **do not include this reasoning in the final answer**.

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the numeric value that represents the *Data type of predictor variables* (i.e., the data modality) from the given research‑paper excerpt.

**Instructions**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Locate the exact numeric value that specifies the data modality of the predictor variables.  
2. **If the numeric value is present:**  
   - Copy it **exactly** as it appears in the text (including any decimal points, commas, or scientific notation).  
   - Do **not** add units, symbols, or any additional characters.  
3. **If the numeric value is absent, ambiguous, or cannot be unambiguously determined:**  
   - Respond with the single character **`Z`**.  
4. **Do not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or infer a value.  
   - Provide any explanation, commentary, or formatting beyond the required answer.  

**Output format**  
- A single line containing either the extracted number **or** the character `Z`.  

**Optional reasoning (for internal verification only – do not include in the answer):**  
- Verify that the number directly refers to the modality (e.g., number of imaging channels, frequency bands, sensor types, etc.).  
- If multiple numbers appear, choose the one explicitly linked to “data type of predictor variables.”

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract a single numeric value from the supplied research‑paper excerpt that corresponds exactly to the *Target Variable* described below.

**Context:**  
The excerpt (inserted where `{context}` appears) is the only source you may use.

**Target Variable**  
- **Name:** *Data type of outcome variable*  
- **What to look for:** The numeric code that identifies the *modality* of the outcome variable (e.g., 1 = continuous, 2 = binary, 3 = ordinal, etc.). The definition of the coding scheme will be present in the excerpt; you must return the numeric code **exactly as it appears**.

**Output Rules**  

1. **If the numeric code is explicitly reported** in the excerpt, output **only that number** (no commas, no spaces, no units, no additional text).  
2. **If the excerpt does not contain the numeric code** (the concept is absent, ambiguous, or cannot be unambiguously determined), output the single character **`Z`**.  
3. Do **not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or infer a value that is not directly stated.  
   - Provide explanations, citations, or any surrounding text.  
   - Add units, symbols, or formatting beyond the plain number or `Z`.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- If multiple numbers appear that could correspond to the target variable, choose the one that is **explicitly linked** to the definition of the data‑type coding (e.g., “Outcome variable coded as 2 = binary”).  
- If a number is mentioned but its meaning is unrelated (e.g., sample size, p‑value), disregard it.  
- If the excerpt contains a range (e.g., “coded as 1‑3”) or a list (e.g., “1 = continuous, 2 = binary”), and the specific modality for the outcome variable is not singled out, return **`Z`**.  

**Formatting**  

```
Answer: <value>
```

Replace `<value>` with the extracted number or `Z` (no quotation marks).  

**Example**  

*Excerpt:* “The primary outcome was a binary variable (coded as 2).”  
*Answer:* `Answer: 2`

*Excerpt:* “Outcome modality was not reported.”  
*Answer:* `Answer: Z`

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant AI. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code that describes the type of the study’s outcome variable, using the coding scheme below.

**Instructions – Follow All Steps Rigorously**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
   - Use only the information that appears **explicitly** in the provided text.  
   - Do **not** rely on outside knowledge, assumptions, or inference.

2. **Determine the outcome‑variable type** according to the definitions in the **Answer Options** section.  
   - If the excerpt mentions the outcome variable and its measurement scale, select the matching code.  
   - If the excerpt does **not** mention the outcome variable type, or if the information is ambiguous or incomplete, answer with **`Z`**.

3. **Output format**  
   - Return **only** a single character: the chosen numeric code (`1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`) **or** the letter `Z`.  
   - Do **not** add any punctuation, spaces, explanations, or additional text.

4. **Edge‑case handling**  
   - **Multiple mentions:** If the excerpt lists several outcomes, choose the code that applies to the *primary* outcome described (the one most prominently discussed or first introduced).  
   - **Mixed descriptions:** If the text mixes terms (e.g., “binary” and “ordinal”), select the code that best matches the **exact definition** given in the Answer Options.  
   - **Numeric values without clear scale:** If numbers are reported but the scale (interval/ratio) is not described, treat the variable as **continuous** (`4`) only when the text explicitly states it is a measured score, scale, or index. Otherwise, use `Z`.

5. **No guessing** – If any required detail is missing, default to `Z`.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign a single code that best matches the “Longitudinal prediction” variable according to the coding scheme below.

**Instructions (follow each step exactly)**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Determine whether the outcome described in the excerpt is (a) already known at the time the predictor data are collected, or (b) will occur in the future relative to the predictor data.**  
   - If the outcome is already known or assessed at the same time as any part of the predictor data → choose **Option 1**.  
   - If the outcome will happen after the predictor data are collected and is therefore unknown at that point → choose **Option 2**.  
3. **If the excerpt provides no information that allows you to decide between the two options, or if the relevant information is missing entirely, answer with the special code **`Z`**.**  
4. **Select **exactly one** code (1, 2, or Z).**  
5. **Return only the selected code—no explanation, no additional characters, no whitespace before or after the digit/letter.**  

**Coding Scheme**  

- **1 – No longitudinal prediction**  
  *The outcome is already known or assessed at the same time as (some parts of) the predictor data.*  
  *Example: predicting personality traits from music‑listening behavior measured concurrently.*

- **2 – Yes, longitudinal prediction**

C: Mean / median / modus imputation - A variable or observation is excluded from the analysis if the proportion of missing data exceeded a predefined threshold (e.g., if more than 50% of its values were missing).
D: k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) imputation - Missing values are replaced using simple rules based on central tendency. Although this is considered a single imputation method, it is coded separately.
E: Multiple imputation methods (if reported, specify algorithm and number of datasets m in comment) - Missing values are imputed by identifying the k observations with the smallest distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) to the incomplete case and aggregating their values for the missing variable (e.g., using the mean, median, or majority vote).
Y: Other - Missing values are imputed multiple times to generate several complete datasets, capturing the uncertainty around the missing data (e.g., predictive mean matching (PMM) with m = 5 imputed datasets).

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the numeric value that directly answers the target variable from the supplied excerpt of a research paper.

**Context:**  
- The only source you may use is the text shown in the *Excerpt* field.  
- Do **not** consult any external files (e.g., code, syntax, supplementary material) unless the authors explicitly reference those materials *within the excerpt* for the specific detail you are extracting.  
- The answer must be taken **exactly** as it appears in the excerpt (including decimal format, integer format, scientific notation, etc.).  

**Target Variable**  
- **Handling of missing data** – the numeric value that the authors report for how missing data were dealt with (e.g., percentage of imputed cases, number of records removed, count of missing entries, etc.).

**Instructions**

1. **Locate the value**  
   - Scan the excerpt for a numeric expression that directly quantifies the handling of missing data.  
   - Accept any of the following numeric forms: integer (e.g., `12`), decimal (e.g., `3.5`), scientific notation (e.g., `1.2e‑4`), or a range that includes a single numeric endpoint (e.g., “between 5 and 5”).  

2. **Return the value**  
   - Output **only** the numeric token (exactly as written) with no surrounding punctuation, units, or commentary.  
   - Example: `0.27` or `15`.

3. **If the value is absent or cannot be determined**  
   - Respond with the single character **`Z`** (capital Z).  
   - This includes cases where the excerpt mentions missing‑data handling qualitatively (e.g., “missing data were ignored”) without a numeric quantification, or where the numeric information is ambiguous (e.g., “≈ 10%”).

4. **Edge‑case handling**  
   - **Multiple numbers:** If more than one numeric value pertains to missing‑data handling, choose the one that most directly answers the target variable (e.g., the percentage of records imputed rather than the total sample size).  
   - **Ambiguous numbers:** If a number could refer to a different concept (e.g., sample size, number of predictors) and it is not explicitly linked to missing‑data handling, treat it as unavailable and output `Z`.  
   - **Ranges:** If the excerpt gives a range (e.g., “5‑7% of cases were imputed”), output the **lower bound** of the range (`5`).  

5. **No additional text**  
   - Do **not** include explanations, units, symbols, or any extra characters.  
   - The answer must be exactly one line containing either the numeric value or `Z`.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. From the excerpt supplied, locate the **numeric value that directly reports the target variable**. Return **only that number** (plain digits, optional decimal point) or the single character **`Z`** if the value is not present, cannot be uniquely identified, or is ambiguous.

---

### Instructions

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Identify any number that *explicitly* quantifies the target variable **Feature enrichment (using domain knowledge to create new or more informative variables).**  

2. **If a single, unambiguous numeric value is found** that corresponds exactly to the target variable, output that value **without any units, commas, symbols, or surrounding text** (e.g., `12.5` or `7`).  

3. **If the excerpt:**  
   - does not mention the target variable,  
   - provides only a qualitative statement,  
   - gives a range (e.g., “between 3 and 5”), a list of possible numbers, or any other ambiguous representation,  
   - spells the number out in words without a clear numeric equivalent,  
   
   **output `Z`.**  

4. **Do not**:  
   - guess, estimate, or infer values.  
   - convert percentages, ratios, or derived metrics unless the excerpt explicitly states the numeric value for feature enrichment.  
   - include explanations, units, symbols, or any additional text.  

5. **only** the final answer (the number or `Z`) should appear after the line `Answer:`.

### Output Format  

```
Answer: <numeric_value_or_Z>
```

*Replace `<numeric_value_or_Z>` with the exact number found or `Z`.*  

---

### Optional Reasoning (for you, not to be output)

- Scan the excerpt for the phrase “feature enrichment” or synonymous wording.  
- Verify that the surrounding context ties the number directly to that concept.  
- If multiple numbers appear, ensure only the one linked to feature enrichment is selected; otherwise, default to `Z`.

- **Description / Guidance:** *See section 2.2 “misshand”* (use only if the excerpt explicitly references this section).  
- **Excerpt:**  
  `{context}`  

**Instructions**  

1. **Locate the value** – Scan the excerpt for a number that is explicitly reported as the measurement, count, percentage, score, or any other quantitative representation of **Feature engineering**.  
2. **Exact copy** – Return the number **exactly as it appears** in the text (preserve decimal points, commas, or scientific notation). Do **not** add units, symbols, or any surrounding characters.  
3. **No value found / ambiguous** – If the excerpt does **not** contain a clear, unambiguous numeric value for the target variable, or if the number cannot be confidently linked to *Feature engineering*, output the single character **`Z`**.  
4. **No inference** – Do not estimate, extrapolate, or infer a value from related information.  
5. **Output format** – Provide **only** the extracted number or the character `Z`. Do not include explanations, labels, markdown, or any additional text.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- If multiple numbers are present, select the one that the text directly ties to *Feature engineering* (e.g., “the feature‑engineering step reduced error by 12 %” → answer `12`).  
- If a number is mentioned but qualifies a different concept (e.g., “the dataset contains 1 000 samples, of which 200 are used for feature engineering”), it does **not** count as the target value and should be ignored.  
- If the number is presented in a range or interval (e.g., “between 5 and 7 features were engineered”), treat this as ambiguous and answer `Z`.

### 1. Target Variable  
**“Data preparation steps performed to train/test set separately”**

- **Code 1 (Jointly)** – The excerpt explicitly states that **at least one** data‑preparation step (e.g., mean imputation, scaling, feature engineering) was applied **jointly** to the training and test data *before* the split or without separate handling.  
- **Code 2 (Separately)** – The excerpt explicitly states that all data‑preparation steps were performed **independently** on the training set and on the test set (e.g., “we normalized the training set and then applied the same parameters to the test set” *or* “each set was pre‑processed separately”).  
- **Code 0 (Not reported)** – The excerpt gives **no information** about whether preparation steps were joint or separate, **or** it mentions preparation steps but does not specify whether they were applied jointly or separately.  
- **Code ‑99 (Not applicable)** – The study does **not use a validation split** (e.g., “no validation”, “internal study, no split”, “all data used for training”).

### 2. Instructions (follow *exactly* in this order)

1. **Read the excerpt** (the text placed where `{context}` appears).  
2. **Determine the correct code** based on the definitions above.  
   - **Do not infer** joint processing from the *order* in which methods are described; the excerpt must *explicitly* say that a step was performed jointly.  
   - **Do not guess** or add information that is not present.  
3. **Handle missing or ambiguous information**:  
   - If the excerpt does **not mention** any preparation step, or mentions steps but never clarifies joint vs. separate handling, output **0**.  
   - If the excerpt makes it clear that **no split was used**, output **‑99**.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the exact numeric value (as it appears in the source) for the specified target variable from the given research‑paper excerpt.

**Context:**  
- **Target Variable:** *Applied ML algorithms for prediction*  
- **Excerpt:** `{context}`  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Locate the value** – Scan the excerpt and find the numeric value that directly reports the target variable.  
2. **Return the value** – Output **only** the number exactly as it appears in the text (including any commas, decimal points, or scientific notation).  
3. **Missing or indeterminate data** – If the excerpt does **not** contain a numeric value for the target variable, or the value is ambiguous/unspecified, output the single character **`Z`**.  
4. **No additional content** – Do **not** include units, symbols, explanations, commentary, or any other text. The response must be either the raw number or `Z`.  
5. **No inference** – Do not estimate, round, or infer a value from surrounding context; use only the explicitly stated figure.  
6. **Edge‑case handling** –  
   - If multiple numbers appear, choose the one that is explicitly linked to the target variable (e.g., “We applied 3 ML algorithms …”).  
   - If a range is given (e.g., “between 2 and 5”), treat the range as **missing** and return `Z`.  
   - If the number is presented in a footnote, table caption, or parenthetical remark that directly references the target variable, it is valid.  

**Answer format:**  
`<numeric value>` or `Z` (nothing else).

**Example:**  
- Excerpt: “Our study employed **4** different ML algorithms for prediction.” → **Answer:** `4`  
- Excerpt: “We evaluated several models, but the exact count is not reported.” → **Answer:** `Z`

Target Variable: Hyperparameter values chosen for tuning
Description: ; If the choice of software strongly suggests certain modeling decisions but the authors do not explicitly report these decisions, the information should be recorded as missing.
Answer Options:
A: Hyperparameter values not mentioned
B: Fixed set of hyperparameter values - Instead of tuning hyperparameters, the authors use predefined fixed values.
C: Hyperparameter values not specified, stated that default values were used - Instead of specifying the hyperparameter values used for model training, the authors merely state that they rely on the default settings of the software.
D: Specific set of hyperparameters values (details in a comment) - The authors explicitly define the range of possible hyperparameter values to be used for tuning.
Excerpt:
{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the exact numeric value(s) that represent the hyper‑parameter values the authors selected for tuning, **as they appear in the supplied excerpt**.

**Context:**  
{context}

**Target Variable:** *Hyperparameter values chosen for tuning*  

**Instructions**

1. **Locate the value** – Scan the excerpt for any number(s) that directly state the hyper‑parameter values used during tuning (e.g., “learning‑rate = 0.01”, “C = 10”, “grid‑search over {0.1,1,10}”, etc.).  
2. **Exact transcription** – Copy the number(s) exactly as written (preserve decimal points, commas, brackets, or ranges). Do **not** modify, round, or convert units.  
3. **Multiple values** –  
   - If the excerpt lists several distinct values for the same hyper‑parameter (e.g., a set or range), output them in the same order, separated by a single comma and a space (`, `).  
   - If different hyper‑parameters are reported, **list only the values for the hyper‑parameter(s) explicitly described as “chosen for tuning.”**  
4. **Missing or ambiguous information** –  
   - If the excerpt does **not** provide a numeric value for the targeted hyper‑parameter, or if the information is only implied (e.g., “the software suggests a default setting”) without an explicit number, answer with the single character `Z`.  
   - If the excerpt contains conflicting numbers and it is impossible to determine which one corresponds to the tuning choice, also answer `Z`.  
5. **Output format** – Respond **only** with the extracted number(s) or `Z`. Do not include any of the following:  
   - Units (e.g., “seconds”, “%”)  
   - Descriptive text, labels, or explanations  
   - Quotations, brackets (unless they are part of the original numeric representation)  
   - Any additional characters or whitespace beyond the required numbers and commas.  

**Reasoning (optional, not part of the answer):**  
You may internally verify that the identified number(s) are explicitly tied to “tuning” rather than to other aspects such as default settings, results, or unrelated parameters. This step is for accuracy only; it must not appear in the final response.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code that best describes the presence and type of a nested data structure used for **model‑training samples**.

**Important Scope Note**  
Only information that explicitly refers to the **training data** matters. Any mention of nested structures for validation, test, or external data **must be ignored** when coding this variable.

---

### Target Variable  
**Nested data structure (training sample only)**  

- **0 – No nested structure**  
- **1 – Hierarchical** – e.g., participants nested within clinics, schools, families, etc.  
- **2 – Longitudinal / repeated measures** – each row is a time‑point nested within an individual (long‑format), with time‑varying predictors/outcomes.  

If the excerpt **does not contain any statement** about a nested structure (or explicitly states that none exists), choose **0**.  
If the excerpt **mentions** a nested structure but does **not specify** whether it is hierarchical or longitudinal, **choose the most specific applicable option** (hierarchical = 1, longitudinal = 2).  

If the excerpt **lacks any information** about nested structures **and** the surrounding context **does not allow you to infer** a structure, answer with **Z**.

---

### Instructions (strict, in order)

1. **Read the excerpt** (provided below) **carefully**.  
2. **Identify any sentence** that directly describes a nested data arrangement **for the training set**.  
3. **Classify** the excerpt using the answer options above.  
4. **Do not**:
   - Guess, infer, or extrapolate from unrelated context.  
   - Consider validation, test, or external datasets.  
   - Provide explanations, reasoning, or any text other than the required code.  
5. **If no relevant information is present**, output **Z**.  
6. **If the excerpt contradicts itself** (e.g., says both “no nesting” and later describes nesting), treat the **most explicit statement** as authoritative.  

**Optional (for internal verification only – do not output):**  
- Briefly note the sentence that led you to your decision (for your own reference).

### Output Format  

- **A single token**: `0`, `1`, `2`, or `Z`.

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the exact numeric value for the specified concept from the given research‑paper excerpt.

**Instructions**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Locate the numeric value that directly corresponds to the *Target Variable* described below.
2. **Exact match only:**  
   - Return the number **exactly as it appears** in the excerpt (including decimal points, commas, or scientific notation).  
   - Do **not** modify the value, add units, or re‑format it in any way.
3. **Missing or indeterminate data:**  
   - If the excerpt does not contain a numeric value for the target concept, or the value is ambiguous / not uniquely identifiable, output the single character `Z`.
4. **No additional content:**  
   - Do **not** provide explanations, reasoning, units, or any other text.  
   - The response must be **exactly one line** containing either the extracted number or `Z`.
5. **Edge‑case handling:**  
   - If multiple numbers appear but only one clearly refers to the target concept, extract that one.  
   - If more than one number for the same concept is presented (e.g., a range or multiple measurements) and the excerpt does not specify which to use, treat the information as ambiguous and answer `Z`.
   - If the number is expressed as a word (e.g., “twenty‑four”), treat it as **not** a numeric value and answer `Z`.
6. **Optional internal reasoning (not shown to the user):**  
   - Internally verify that the number you select is directly linked to the target concept by checking surrounding words and sentence structure.  
   - If any doubt remains after this verification, default to `Z`.

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the numeric value that directly answers the target variable from the given research‑paper excerpt.

**Context:**  
The excerpt (between the lines `---Excerpt Start---` and `---Excerpt End---`) contains the only source you may use.

**Target Variable:**  
*Handling of class imbalance*  

**Instructions**

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
   - Locate any numeric value that explicitly quantifies the target variable (e.g., “class‑imbalance ratio = 3:1”, “minority‑class proportion = 0.12”, “oversampling increased F1 by 4.5%”, etc.).  
   - The value must be *exactly* as it appears in the text (including decimal points, commas, or ratios). **Do not convert, round, or re‑format the number.**  

2. **If a numeric value for the target variable is present:**  
   - Output **only** that value, with no units, symbols (unless they are part of the numeric expression itself, e.g., “3:1”), no surrounding text, and no explanation.  
   - Example output: `3:1` or `0.12` or `4.5`.

3. **If the excerpt does not contain a numeric value for the target variable, or the information is ambiguous, incomplete, or indirect:**  
   - Output the single character `Z`.  
   - Do **not** attempt to infer, estimate, or calculate a value from related numbers.

4. **Handling edge cases**  
   - **Multiple numeric mentions:** If more than one number could answer the target variable, choose the one that directly addresses the definition of “handling of class imbalance” (e.g., a reported ratio, proportion, or performance change specifically tied to class‑imbalance handling). If still ambiguous, output `Z`.  
   - **Ranges or intervals:** If the excerpt reports a range (e.g., “between 2 and 5”), treat this as ambiguous and output `Z`.  
   - **Non‑numeric descriptors:** Words such as “high”, “low”, “moderate”, or qualitative statements do not count; output `Z`.  
   - **Embedded symbols:** If the number includes a colon, slash, or percentage sign as part of the reported value, retain it exactly (e.g., `3:1`, `45%`).  

5. **Output format**  
   - The answer must be a **single line** containing either the exact numeric value or the character `Z`.  
   - No additional characters, whitespace, or newline after the answer.

**Target Variable:** Sampling method applied  

**Instructions**

1. **Locate the Value**  
   - Scan the excerpt for a **numeric value** that directly answers the target variable.  
   - The value must appear **exactly as written** in the text (including any decimal points, commas, or sign).  

2. **If the Value Is Present**  
   - Output **only the numeric string** (e.g., `42`, `3.7`, `1,024`).  
   - Do **not** add units, symbols, explanations, or any surrounding text.

3. **If the Value Is Absent, Unclear, or Ambiguous**  
   - Output the single character **`Z`**.  
   - Do not attempt to infer, estimate, or guess the number.

4. **Edge‑Case Handling**  
   - If multiple numeric values are present, choose the one that **explicitly refers to the sampling method** (e.g., “sample size = 150”, “n = 200”).  
   - If the excerpt mentions a range (e.g., “between 50 and 60”) or a conditional statement (“if > 30”), treat this as **ambiguous** and output `Z`.  
   - If the number is part of a citation, reference number, or unrelated statistic, ignore it.

5. **Output Format**  
   - The answer must be a **single line** containing **only** the numeric value or `Z`.  
   - No additional characters, whitespace, or line breaks before/after the answer.

**Example**  

- Excerpt: “The study employed a simple random sampling method with a sample size of **120** participants.” → **Answer:** `120`

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑paper assistant. From the supplied excerpt, you must assign **exactly one code** that reflects how the authors describe the “best‑performing model” in a comparative evaluation.

**Coding Scheme**  

| Code | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **1** | The authors state that *no* algorithm outperforms the others (i.e., they do not identify a single best‑performing model). |
| **99**| The authors name a specific algorithm as best‑performing **even though** the reported performance metrics of the other algorithms contradict that claim. In this case you must also provide the algorithm’s name in a comment (see “Output Format”). |
| **Z** | The excerpt contains **no information** about which algorithm, if any, is considered best‑performing. |

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Use only the information explicitly presented in the excerpt. Do **not** infer, guess, or use external knowledge.  
2. **Determine the appropriate code** according to the definitions above.  
3. **If the excerpt mentions a specific algorithm as best‑performing and the performance numbers clearly support that claim**, assign **99** **only** when the numbers *contradict* the claim. If the numbers are consistent with the claim, treat the situation as “no contradiction” and code **1** (no algorithm outperforms) only when the authors explicitly say no algorithm is superior.  
4. **If the excerpt does not discuss best‑performing models at all**, return **Z**.  
5. **If the excerpt is ambiguous** (e.g., it hints at a best model but does not state it clearly), treat this as missing information and return **Z**.  

**Output Format**  

- Return **only** the required code (`1`, `99`, or `Z`).  
- If you return `99`, append a comment on the same line after a single space, using the exact algorithm name as given in the excerpt.  
  - Example: `99 RandomForest`  

No additional text, explanations, or formatting should be included.

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- *Multiple algorithms claimed as best*: Treat as “no algorithm outperforms others” → code **1**.  
- *Contradictory performance data*: Use code **99** with the named algorithm.  
- *No performance data provided*: If an algorithm is named as best but no numbers are shown, this is not a contradiction; code **1** (unless the authors explicitly say no algorithm is best).  
- *Zero or missing values in related variables* (e.g., if a preceding variable indicates “not applicable”): Follow the same rule—code **Z** only when the excerpt truly lacks any best‑model information.

<td><pre>**Task:** Extract a single numeric value from the given excerpt that corresponds exactly to the specified target variable.  

**Instructions**

1. **Read the entire excerpt carefully.** Identify any number that directly reports the value for the **Target Variable**.

2. **If a clear, explicit numeric value for the target variable is present:**  
   - Return **only that number** (use the same digits as in the source, without commas, spaces, units, or any additional characters).  

3. **If the excerpt does not contain a numeric value for the target variable, or the information is ambiguous, incomplete, or indirect (e.g., “approximately”, “around”, “estimated”, “>”, “<”, “≈”, ranges, or any inferred value):**  
   - Return the single character **`Z`**.

4. **Do not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or calculate a value.  
   - Convert units, round, or modify the number in any way.  
   - Include explanations, units, symbols, punctuation (except the final period of the answer line), or any text beyond the required output.

5. **Output format** (must be followed exactly):  

```
Target Variable: <exact phrase as given>
Description: <as provided>
Excerpt:
<the excerpt text>
Answer: <numeric value or Z>
```

**Edge‑case handling**

- If multiple numbers appear but only one directly answers the target variable, choose that one.  
- If multiple numbers could plausibly answer the target variable and the document does not specify which applies, treat the situation as ambiguous and output `Z`.  
- If the number is presented as part of a range (e.g., “5–7”), treat it as ambiguous → `Z`.  
- If the number is expressed with qualifiers such as “approximately”, “about”, “~”, “<”, “>”, or any non‑exact wording, treat it as ambiguous → `Z`.  

**Reasoning (optional for internal use only):**  
Before answering, verify that the number is explicitly linked to the target variable in the same sentence or clause, without reliance on inference or external knowledge.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task:** Extract the exact numeric value for the specified target variable from the given excerpt of a research paper.

**Context:**  
The excerpt (the text between the markers `{context}`) is the only source you may consult.

**Target Variable:**  
- **Name:** Train‑test split ratio  

**Output Requirements:**  
- Return **only** the numeric value that appears in the excerpt for the train‑test split ratio.  
- If the excerpt does **not** contain a train‑test split ratio, or the ratio cannot be unambiguously identified, output the single character **`Z`**.  
- Do **not** add units, explanations, symbols, or any other text.  

**Extraction Rules:**  
1. **Exact Match:** Use the exact number as it is written in the excerpt (e.g., `0.8`, `80%`, `4:1`).  
2. **Standardize Form:**  
   - If the ratio is expressed as a percentage, convert it to a decimal (e.g., `80%` → `0.8`).  
   - If expressed as a colon‑separated ratio (e.g., `4:1`), convert it to a decimal by dividing the first term by the sum of both terms (`4/(4+1) = 0.8`).  
   - If multiple possible values appear, choose the **first** value that clearly refers to the train‑test split.  
3. **Ambiguity Handling:**  
   - If the number could refer to a different concept (e.g., validation split, cross‑validation folds) and it is not explicitly labeled as the train‑test split, treat it as missing and output `Z`.  
4. **Missing or Unclear Information:**  
   - If no numeric expression related to the train‑test split is present, output `Z`.  

**Procedure:**  
1. Read the excerpt between `{context}`.  
2. Locate any numeric expression that is explicitly tied to the train‑test split ratio.  
3. Apply the conversion rules above if needed.  
4. Output the final numeric value **or** `Z` if the information is absent or ambiguous.

**Context:**  
{context}

**Target Variable**  
- **Name:** Performance measures reported for test set  
- **Description:** (as defined in the source document)

**Instructions**

1. **Locate the value** – Scan the excerpt and find the number that directly reports the *Performance measures reported for test set*. Use the value **exactly as it appears** in the text (including decimal points, commas, or scientific notation). Do **not** modify, round, or convert the number.

2. **When the value is present** – Output **only** that numeric string.  
   *Example:* `0.842` or `1.23e‑4`

3. **When the value is absent, ambiguous, or cannot be determined** – Output the single character `Z`.

4. **Do not**:
   - Guess, estimate, or infer a value that is not explicitly stated.  
   - Include units, symbols, explanations, or any additional text.  
   - Add commentary, interpretation, or any content not found verbatim in the excerpt.

5. **Edge‑case handling**  
   - If multiple numbers are reported for the target variable, choose the one that is **clearly labeled** as the performance measure for the *test set* (e.g., “test‑set accuracy = 0.91”).  
   - If numbers are presented in a table or figure caption, extract the value that the caption or surrounding text directly associates with the test‑set performance.  
   - If the excerpt only provides a range (e.g., “accuracy between 0.85 and 0.90”) or a statistical summary without a single point estimate, treat this as **missing** and output `Z`.

**Output Format**  
A single line containing **only** the extracted numeric value or the character `Z`.

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read the supplied excerpt and decide whether the excerpt **explicitly reports performance metrics for the training set**.

**Target Variable**  
*Performance metrics reported for training set*

**Answer Options**  
- `1` – No (the excerpt does **not** contain any training‑set performance metrics)  
- `2` – Yes (the excerpt **does** contain training‑set performance metrics)  
- `Z` – The requested information is **absent** from the excerpt (i.e., the excerpt does not mention training‑set performance metrics at all).  

**Instructions (follow in order)**  

1. **Read the excerpt** carefully. Use only the information that is *explicitly* present in the excerpt; do **not** infer, guess, or rely on external knowledge.  
2. **Determine** whether the excerpt contains a clear statement of performance metrics for the training set.  
   - If the excerpt contains such a statement, select `2`.  
   - If the excerpt discusses performance metrics but **only** for validation, test, or any set other than the training set, select `1`.  
   - If the excerpt makes no mention of any performance metrics for the training set (i.e., the information is missing), select `Z`.  
3. **Ambiguity / Uncertainty**:  
   - If the excerpt is vague, contradictory, or could be interpreted in more than one way, treat it as *missing* and answer `Z`.  
   - Do **not** attempt to resolve ambiguity by guessing; the safe choice is `Z`.  
4. **Output format**:  
   - Return **only** the single character/number (`1`, `2`, or `Z`).  
   - Do **not** include any explanations, punctuation, whitespace, or additional text.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant whose sole job is to pull a single numeric value from a supplied excerpt of a research paper.

**Target Variable**  
- **Name:** Highest performance achieved in the test sample  
- **What to extract:** The exact numeric value that the authors report as the *highest* performance for the test sample.

**Input Format**  
```
Excerpt:
{context}
```
`{context}` will be replaced by the paper excerpt.

**Output Requirements**  
- Return **only** the numeric value **exactly as it appears** in the excerpt (e.g., `0.87`, `92.5`, `123`).  
- Do **not** include units, symbols (%, $, etc.), commas, spaces, or any additional text.  
- If the excerpt does **not** contain a clear, unambiguous value for the target variable, answer with the single character **`Z`**.  
- Do **not** guess, infer, or estimate; use the document verbatim.

**Handling Special Cases**  

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Multiple numbers appear in the excerpt | Identify the number that is explicitly described as the *highest performance* for the **test sample** and return that one. |
| The number is written with a unit or symbol (e.g., “85 %”, “0.92 AU”) | Strip the unit/symbol and return only the numeric part (`85` or `0.92`). |
| The number is embedded in a range or interval (e.g., “between 0.78 and 0.85”) | If the excerpt does **not** state a single “highest” value, output `Z`. |
| The phrase “highest performance” is absent but a single performance value is clearly labeled for the test sample (e.g., “Test‑sample accuracy: 0.91”) | Treat that value as the highest performance and return it. |
| Ambiguity remains after following the rules above | Output `Z`. |

**Procedure (for internal reasoning – do **not** include in the answer)**  

1. Scan the excerpt for any numeric expressions.  
2. Locate the sentence or clause that mentions the *test sample* and a notion of *highest* performance (keywords: “highest”, “best”, “peak”, “maximum”).  
3. Verify that the number directly follows or is linked to that description.  
4. Strip any non‑numeric characters (units, percent signs, commas).  
5. Output the cleaned number, or `Z` if a suitable value cannot be found.

Excerpt:
{context}
Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are a research‑assistant whose sole job is to read a single excerpt from a research paper and decide whether it contains *confidence intervals for performance metrics*.

**Target Variable**  
- **Confidence intervals for performance metrics** – does the excerpt explicitly report a confidence interval (e.g., “95 % CI = [0.78, 0.84]”, “± 0.05”, “confidence interval of the AUC”, etc.) for any performance measure?

**Answer Coding Scheme**  
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **1** | The excerpt **does not** contain any confidence interval for a performance metric. |
| **2** | The excerpt **does** contain at least one confidence interval for a performance metric. |
| **Z** | The excerpt provides **no information** relevant to the target variable (e.g., the excerpt is unrelated, empty, or the presence/absence of a confidence interval cannot be determined). |

**Instructions (follow in order)**  

1. **Read the excerpt** given in the `{context}` placeholder.  
2. **Search only the text that is present**; do not use external knowledge or make assumptions.  
3. **Determine** whether a confidence interval for a performance metric is *explicitly* reported.  
   - Acceptable forms include numeric ranges, “±” notation, or any phrase that clearly states a confidence interval.  
   - The interval must be tied to a performance metric (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, etc.).  
4. **Select exactly one code** from the table above that best reflects the content.  
5. **Output** *only* the single character/code (e.g., `1`, `2`, or `Z`). Do **not** add any explanation, punctuation, or whitespace.  

**Handling Special Cases**  

- **Missing or ambiguous information**: If the excerpt does not mention confidence intervals at all, or the mention is vague (e.g., “the results were reliable”) without a numeric interval, answer `Z`.  
- **Multiple statements**: If any statement in the excerpt satisfies the “Yes” condition, answer `2`.  
- **Contradictory statements**: If the excerpt both includes and excludes confidence intervals, prioritize the presence and answer `2`.  

**Reasoning (optional, for internal verification only)**  
- You may mentally note why you chose the code, but **do not** include that reasoning in the final output.  

**Example**

<td><pre>**Role**  
You are an expert research assistant tasked with extracting a single numeric value from a research‑paper excerpt.

**Task**  
Identify the numeric value that represents the **“Significance test(s)”** as reported in the excerpt below.

**Output format**  
- If a numeric value for the target variable is explicitly present in the excerpt, output **only that number** (no commas, units, symbols, or surrounding text).  
- If the excerpt does **not** contain a clear, unambiguous numeric value for the target variable, output the single character **`Z`**.  
- Do **not** add explanations, reasoning, or any other characters.

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Search for any explicit numeric expression that directly quantifies the “Significance test(s)” (e.g., p‑values, test statistics, chi‑square values, F‑values, t‑values, etc.).  
2. **Extract exactly the number** as it appears (preserve decimal points, scientific notation, or sign). Do not round, convert, or reformat the value.  
3. **Do not infer or estimate** a value when it is missing, vague, or described only qualitatively (e.g., “significant”, “not significant”, “p < 0.05”). In such cases, output `Z`.  
4. **Handle ambiguous cases**:  
   - If multiple numbers appear, use the one that is explicitly labeled as the result of the significance test (e.g., “p = 0.03”, “χ² = 5.67”).  
   - If numbers are present but none are linked to a significance test, treat the target as not reported → output `Z`.  
5. **Missing information**: If the excerpt provides no numeric data for the target variable, output `Z`.  
6. **Strict compliance**: Do not add any units, symbols (like “p=” or “=”), commas, or spaces. The answer must be exactly the number or the single character `Z`.

1. **Locate the value** – Scan the excerpt for a **explicit numeric value** that quantifies the target variable. The number must appear **exactly as written** in the text (e.g., “42”, “3.7”, “10 %”, “1‑2”).  

2. **Return the value** –  
   - If a clear numeric value is found, output **only that value** (no commas, spaces, units, symbols, or surrounding text).  
   - If the excerpt contains **multiple numeric values**, select the one that directly corresponds to the target variable. If ambiguity remains, treat it as “not reported”.  

3. **Missing or ambiguous data** – If the excerpt:  
   - does not mention a numeric value for the target variable,  
   - uses vague language such as “several”, “many”, “few”, “approximately”, “around”, or any non‑numeric descriptor,  
   - or presents contradictory numbers,  

   then respond with **`Z`**.

4. **No inference or estimation** – Do **not** infer, round, convert, or estimate values that are not explicitly stated. Do not perform unit conversions; if a number includes a unit that would change its magnitude (e.g., “0.5 kg”), still return the raw numeric part (“0.5”).  

5. **Output format** – Provide **exactly one token**: either the numeric value (as it appears) or the single character `Z`. Do not add explanations, punctuation, or any additional text.

**Optional reasoning (for internal use only):**  
- Identify the sentence(s) containing the target variable.  
- Verify that the numeric token directly quantifies the variable.  
- Confirm there is no qualifier that makes the number uncertain.

<td><pre>**Role**  
You are an expert research assistant.  

**Task**  
From the excerpt supplied, determine **how many separate limitations are explicitly listed in the paper’s discussion section**.

**Instructions**  

1. **Locate the discussion section** (if the excerpt contains a heading such as “Discussion,” “Discussion and Limitations,” or any paragraph that is clearly the discussion).  
2. **Identify each distinct limitation** that the authors explicitly state (e.g., “a major limitation is…”, “we were limited by…”, “the study’s small sample size is a limitation,” etc.).  
3. **Count** the number of these distinct limitations.  
4. **Output only** the integer count (e.g., `3`).  
5. If the excerpt **does not contain a discussion section**, **does not mention any limitations**, or the information is **unclear/ambiguous** (e.g., it is vague whether a statement is a limitation), output **exactly `Z`**.  
6. **Do not**:  
   - Guess, estimate, or infer numbers that are not explicitly stated.  
   - Provide units, explanations, or any additional text.  
   - Add commentary or reinterpret the authors’ statements.  

**Edge‑Case Handling**  

- If a limitation is mentioned more than once, count it only **once**.  
- If a sentence lists several limitations together (e.g., “limitations include small sample size and short follow‑up”), count each item separately.  
- If the excerpt mixes limitations with other discussion points and you cannot unambiguously separate them, treat the entire excerpt as **no clear limitation** and answer `Z`.  

**Output Format**

<td><pre>**Task Overview**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a short excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code from the list below that best describes how the authors treat model‑comparison results in that excerpt.

**How to Choose the Code**  
- **Read the excerpt carefully.** Base your decision **solely on the information explicitly present** in the text.  
- **Do not infer, guess, or add any interpretation that is not written in the excerpt.**  
- If the excerpt contains **no information** about model comparison (i.e., the authors do not mention comparing models at all, or they only describe models without any comparison), select the appropriate code as defined below.  
- If the excerpt is **missing** or **does not address** the target variable, answer with **`Z`**.  

**Target Variable**  
*Interpretation of model comparison*  

**Answer Options (choose **one**)**  

| Code | Meaning (exact wording to match) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| **1** | *No comparisons / descriptive comparisons made* – The authors mention model performance but either (a) give only descriptive statements (e.g., “Model A performed slightly better than Model B”) **without any explanation**, or (b) do **not** perform any model comparison at all. |
| **2** | *Interpretative comparisons* – The authors draw **explicit conclusions** about the data’s structure or relationships **based on** the model comparison (e.g., “The superior performance of the random forest over the elastic net suggests the presence of interaction effects”). |
| **-99** | *Not applicable* – Use this only if the broader coding scheme indicates that the variable should be ignored (e.g., when a preceding question 4.1 is coded as 0). |
| **Z** | *Information not provided* – The excerpt does not contain any statement about model comparison, or the requested information is absent. |

**Output Format**  
- Respond with **only the selected code** (e.g., `1`, `2`, `-99`, or `Z`).  
- **No additional text, explanations, or punctuation** are allowed.  

**Procedure**  

1. Locate any mention of **model comparison** in the excerpt.  
2. Determine whether the mention is **descriptive only** (code 1) or **interpretative** (code 2).  
3. If the excerpt explicitly states that the variable is **not applicable** (per the overall coding scheme), use `-99`.  
4. If no relevant information is present, output `Z`.

Answer:</pre></td>
<td><pre>**Task**  
You are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a supplied excerpt from a research paper and assign **exactly one** code that best describes how the authors discuss the *generalizability of model performance and variable‑importance measures*.

**Coding Scheme**  
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **0** | No statement about generalizability is present. |
| **1** | The authors **explicitly claim** that their model (or variable‑importance results) generalizes **beyond the sample used** (e.g., “our model trained on U.S. data will work in other cultures”). |
| **2** | The authors **limit** their claims to the data analyzed **or explicitly question** any generalization beyond the sampling frame (e.g., “results from this region may not apply elsewhere”). |
| **Z** | The excerpt provides **no information** relevant to the target variable (i.e., the passage is unrelated or empty). |

**Input**  
- `Excerpt:` {context} – a verbatim excerpt from a research paper.  
- `Target Variable:` Generalizability of model performance and variable‑importance measures.

**Instructions**  

1. **Read the excerpt carefully.**  
2. **Identify any sentence(s) that address the target variable.**  
3. **Select the single code (0, 1, 2, or Z) that most accurately reflects the authors’ stance**, according to the definitions above.  
4. **Do not infer or guess** beyond what is explicitly written. If the excerpt contains no relevant statement, choose **Z**.  
5. **If multiple statements are present, apply the following hierarchy** (highest priority first):  
   - Any explicit claim of broader applicability → **Code 1**.  
   - Any explicit limitation or questioning of broader applicability → **Code 2**.  
   - No mention at all → **Code 0**.  
6. **Return only the chosen code** (e.g., `1`). No explanation, punctuation, or additional text is allowed.

**Handling Edge Cases**  

- **Ambiguous language** (e.g., “might be applicable”) should be treated as a *claim of possible generalization* only if the authors present it as a definitive expectation; otherwise, treat it as **no statement** → **Code 0**.  
- **Conditional statements** (e.g., “if applied to other settings, the model could perform similarly”) are considered **claims of generalizability** → **Code 1**.  
- **Explicit negation** (e.g., “cannot be generalized”) → **Code 2**.  
- **Missing or empty excerpt** → **Z**.
