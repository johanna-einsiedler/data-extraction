Your response must consist **only** of the letter(s) that correspond to the correct answer(s) from the list below, formatted exactly as described.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Coding Scheme (Answer Options)\n\n| Letter | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| **A** | Up |\n| **B** | Down |\n| **C** | SMOTE |\n| **Y** | Other (any sampling method mentioned that is **not** Up, Down, or SMOTE) |\n| **Z** | None of the above – the excerpt contains **no information** about the sampling method |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Extraction Rules  \n\n1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Identify any explicit mention of a sampling method.  \n2. **Match the mention to the coding scheme:**  \n   - If the excerpt states **“Up”**, select **A**.  \n   - If it states **“Down”**, select **B**.  \n   - If it states **“SMOTE”**, select **C**.  \n   - If it mentions any other sampling technique (e.g., “random oversampling”, “stratified sampling”, etc.), select **Y**.  \n3. **Multiple methods:** If the excerpt lists *more than one* distinct sampling method, return **all applicable letters** separated by commas and no spaces (e.g., `A,C`). Preserve the order **A → B → C → Y** when multiple letters are needed.  \n4. **No method mentioned:** If the excerpt contains **no reference** to any sampling method, answer **Z**.  \n5. **Ambiguous or contradictory statements:**  \n   - If the excerpt is unclear (e.g., “we used a sampling technique”) **without naming it**, treat it as **no information** → **Z**.  \n   - If the excerpt contains conflicting methods (e.g., “both Up and SMOTE were applied”), include **all** relevant letters (`A,C`).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Handling Missing or Unclear Information  \n\n- **Do not infer** a method that is not explicitly named.  \n- **Do not guess** based on context outside the excerpt.  \n- If the excerpt mentions a method but the spelling or case differs (e.g., “up‑sampling”, “SMOTE‑based”), still map it to the appropriate letter (A, B, C, or Y) as long as the meaning is clear.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Output Format  \n\n- **Only** the letter(s) described above.  \n- If multiple letters are required, separate them with a **single comma** and **no spaces** (e.g., `A,C,Y`).  \n- If a single letter applies, output that single character (e.g., `B`).  \n- **Never** include explanations, headings, or any additional text.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Reasoning (optional, for internal use)  \n\nYou may briefly verify the mapping internally before responding, but **do not** output any of that reasoning.  \n\n---\n\n### 6.

To provide a benchmark against the machine learning models, an \nordinary least squares regression (OLS) model with all the available \nsame predictors (in the same manner as the machine learning models) \nwas included. The multiple OLS acts as a comparator with penalised \nregression models by fitting the data without any regularisation, making \nit prone to overfitting compared to models with regularisation. Addi\ntionally, two other comparison models akin to those used in similar \nresearch were fitted (Buckman et al., 2021a). The first was an OLS \nregression model with only the pre-treatment GAD-7 score included, as \ninitial symptom severity is one of the most important factors considered \nby clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes (and allocating treat\nment) for their patients (Amati et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2021b; \nO’Driscoll et al., 2021). Separately, a null model was created using the \nmean post-treatment GAD-7 score in the training and validation dataset \nas the prediction for all test dataset cases. Five models based upon elastic \nnet regularised regression (ENR; Friedman et al., 2010) were included \n(alpha parameters were 0.0; full ridge, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0; full \nlasso), using the ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection oper\nator (lasso) penalisations to reduce overfitting. Two spline regression \nmodels were used: adaptive splines (Friedman, 1991) and adaptive \npolynomial splines (Stone et al., 1997). In addition, two \ndecision-tree-based algorithms were used: random forest (Breiman, \n2001) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., \n2010).

From the excerpt provided, you must determine how the authors handled **data‑preparation steps for the training set versus the test set** and code the answer according to the scheme below.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What you must decide  \n\n- **Jointly** – the same preparation step(s) were applied to *both* the training and test data at the same time.  \n- **Separately** – the preparation step(s) were applied to the training data **and** to the test data **independently** (i.e., the test data were never used to influence the training‑set processing).  \n\nIf the excerpt does not mention any data‑preparation step for the training or test set, or if it is impossible to tell from the text, you must indicate that the information is **not reported**.\n\nIf the study does **not** use a validation split (e.g., “no validation”, “internal study, no split”), the variable is **not applicable**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Coding scheme (choose **exactly one**)\n\n| Code | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **0** | Not reported – the excerpt gives no information about whether preparation was joint or separate. |\n| **1** | Jointly – it is explicitly stated that a preparation step was performed *jointly* on training + test data. |\n| **2** | Separately – it is explicitly stated that preparation steps were performed *separately* on training and test data. |\n| **-99** | Not applicable – the study has “no validation” or “internal, no split” as described in section 4.2. |\n\n*Important:* **Only** code **1** when the document **clearly** says the step was performed jointly. Do **not** infer joint processing from the order in which methods are described or from any chronological narrative.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Handling special cases  \n\n- **Missing information** – If the excerpt provides no mention of training‑test preparation, return **0**.  \n- **Ambiguous or contradictory statements** – If you cannot determine a single, unambiguous answer, also return **0**.  \n- **No validation / no split** – If the excerpt contains a phrase such as “no validation”, “internal study, no split”, or any equivalent wording indicating that a test set was never created, return **-99**.  \n- **Multiple preparation steps** – If some steps are joint *and* others are separate, follow the rule in the original description: code as **1 (Jointly)** **only** when it is *clearly* stated that a step was performed jointly. Otherwise, treat the overall variable as **0 (Not reported)** because the information is mixed/unclear.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Output format  \n\n- Return **only the numeric code** (0, 1, 2, or -99).  \n- Do **not** include any explanation, label, or additional characters.  \n- Example of a correct response: `2`\n\n---\n\n### 5. Reasoning (optional, for internal use only)  \n\nYou may briefly note to yourself why you chose a particular code, but **do not** output that reasoning. It is only for your internal verification.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Prompt template  \n\n```\nExcerpt:\n{context}\n\nYour answer:\n```\n\nReplace `{context}` with the provided excerpt and write the single numeric code on the line after “Your answer:”.",

From the supplied excerpt, you must assign **exactly one code** that best represents how the authors treat model comparison, according to the coding scheme below.\n\n**Output Requirement**  \n- Return **only the code** (e.g., `1`, `2`, `Z`, or `-99`).  \n- No additional words, symbols, explanations, or whitespace are allowed.\n\n**Coding Scheme**  \n\n| Code | Meaning (must be supported by the excerpt) |\n|------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **1** | **Descriptive comparison** – the authors mention or show model performance differences **without providing an explanatory interpretation** (e.g., “Random forest achieved 85 % accuracy, elastic net 78 %”). |\n| **2** | **Interpretative comparison** – the authors **draw a conclusion or hypothesis** about why one model outperforms another or what the comparison reveals about the data (e.g., “The superior performance of the random forest suggests the presence of interaction effects”). |\n| **Z** | The excerpt **contains no information** about model comparison (no mention of multiple models, performance metrics, or any comparison). |\n| **-99** | The target variable is **not applicable** because the prerequisite condition “0 in 4.1” is true. *(If you do not have that prerequisite information, ignore this code and follow the other rules.)* |\n\n**Decision Procedure**  \n\n1. **Search the excerpt** for any reference to **two or more predictive models** (e.g., random forest, elastic net, SVM, etc.) and any **performance metric** or result that links them.  \n2. **Classify the nature of the comparison**:  \n   - If the text only **reports numbers or statements** about which model performed better **without explaining why**, select **1**.  \n   - If the text **provides an explanation, hypothesis, or inference** about the reason for the performance difference or what it implies about the data, select **2**.  \n3. **If both types appear**, the interpretative element supersedes the descriptive one; choose **2**.  \n4. **If no model‑comparison content is found**, output **Z**.  \n5. **If you know that “0 in 4.1” applies**, output **-99** regardless of the excerpt content.  \n\n**Handling Ambiguity & Missing Information**  \n\n- **Do not infer** missing details. If the excerpt is vague (e.g., “Model A performed better”) and provides no explanatory reason, treat it as **descriptive** (code 1).  \n- If the excerpt mentions only a single model or only general performance without a comparative reference, treat it as **no comparison** (code Z).  \n- If the excerpt contains contradictory statements, prioritize the **most explicit** statement present.  \n\n**Optional Reasoning (for your internal use only)**  \nYou may silently note why you chose a particular code to improve accuracy, but **do not include that reasoning in the final answer**.\n\n---  \n\n**Excerpt:**  \n{context}  \n\n**Answer:**",

While comparing the two models, we offered more flexibility to the RF to fit complexity beyond linear additive effects. Our results suggested that the RF outperformed the LM in the cross-validation step and indicated that the RF had some advantage in predicting leadership role occupancy in the test set. These results suggest that modeling complexity beyond linear and additive effects of traits has some added value in predicting leadership role occupancy (RQ 1), supporting the interactionist accounts of the leader-trait paradigm.\" (Section \"Discussion; p.9)\n True Answer: ['Y']\n Excerpt: {context} Answer:"

Coding Target  \n**Variable:** *Package / library / modeling framework version reported*  \n\n**Definition:**  \n- **“Yes”** – The authors **explicitly** list the exact version number(s) of any machine‑learning‑related software (e.g., “scikit‑learn 1.2.2”, “caret 6.0‑93”, “mlr3 0.15.0”).  \n- **“No”** – No version numbers are mentioned.  \n- **“Z”** – The excerpt does not contain any information about software packages, libraries, or modeling frameworks (i.e., the target is completely absent).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Answer Options (choose **exactly one**)  \n\n| Code | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **1** | No – the excerpt discusses software but does **not** provide version numbers. |\n| **2** | Yes – the excerpt **explicitly** reports version numbers of ML‑related packages, libraries, or meta‑modeling frameworks. |\n| **Z** | Not applicable – the excerpt contains **no** reference to any package, library, or modeling framework at all. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Instructions (strictly followed)\n\n1. **Read the excerpt** (the text appearing after `Excerpt:`) **carefully**.  \n2. **Identify** whether the excerpt mentions any ML‑related package, library, or modeling framework **and** whether a **specific version number** is provided.  \n3. **Select the single appropriate code** from the table above:\n   - If a version number is present → **2**.  \n   - If the software is mentioned **without** a version → **1**.  \n   - If there is **no mention** of software at all → **Z**.  \n4. **Do not infer** missing information, extrapolate from other sections, or use external knowledge.  \n5. **Do not provide any explanation, justification, or additional text**—output **only** the chosen code (e.g., `2`).  \n6. **Edge‑case handling**:  \n   - If multiple packages are listed and **any one** includes an explicit version, the correct code is **2**.  \n   - If the excerpt contains ambiguous phrasing such as “using the latest version” or “version X.Y.Z (unspecified)”, treat this as **no explicit version** → **1**.  \n   - If the excerpt is empty or consists solely of non‑technical filler, answer **Z**.  \n\n---\n\n### 4.

Do **not** infer or guess based on external knowledge.  \n5. **If contradictory statements appear** (both “preregistered” and “not preregistered”), prioritize the **most explicit** claim.

            "rewritten_prompt": "**Task Overview**  \nYou are an expert research assistant. Your job is to read a supplied excerpt from a research paper and determine the **Country (or countries) where the data were collected**. You must then encode this information using the predefined coding scheme below.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Source‑only Requirement  \n- **Base every decision exclusively on the information that appears in the excerpt.**  \n- Do **not** infer, guess, or add any knowledge that is not explicitly stated.  \n- Do **not** provide explanations, comments, or any text other than the final answer.\n\n### 2. Mapping the Country  \n| Letter | Country (or grouping) |\n|--------|-----------------------|\n| **A** | Cross‑cultural (specific countries not listed) |\n| **B** | USA |\n| **C** | UK |\n| **D** | Germany |\n| **E** | Australia |\n| **F** | Canada |\n| **G** | China |\n| **H** | Netherlands |\n| **I** | France |\n| **J** | Italy |\n| **K** | Brazil |\n| **L** | Spain |\n| **M** | Japan |\n| **N** | Turkey |\n| **O** | South Korea |\n| **P** | Sweden |\n| **Q** | Switzerland |\n| **R** | Israel |\n| **S** | Norway |\n| **Y** | **Other** (any country not listed, or a region/continent that cannot be mapped to a specific listed country) |\n| **Z** | Not reported (no country, city, state, region, or any geographic cue is present) |\n\n### 3. How to Choose the Letter(s)\n\n1. **Exact country name** – If the excerpt names a country that appears in the table, output the corresponding letter.  \n2. **City/State/Region → Country** – If only a city, state, province, or region is mentioned, map it to its country **provided the mapping is unambiguous** (e.g., “Toronto” → Canada). Use the appropriate letter.  \n3. **Multiple countries** – If the excerpt clearly indicates data from more than one distinct country, list **all applicable letters** separated by commas, in **alphabetical order** (e.g., `B,D,G`).  \n4. **Cross‑cultural design** – If the study explicitly states it is “cross‑cultural” or “multinational” **without listing the specific countries**, output **A**.  \n5. **Other country** – If the country is mentioned but it is **not** in the table (e.g., “India”), output **Y**.  \n6. **Only a continent/region** – If the excerpt refers only to a continent or a vague region (e.g., “Europe”, “Southeast Asia”) and no specific country can be derived, output **Y**.  \n7. **Ambiguous city/region** – If a place name could belong to more than one country (e.g., “Springfield”) and the excerpt does not clarify which one, treat this as **Z** (Not reported).  \n8. **No geographic information** – If the excerpt contains no reference to a country, city, state, or region, output **Z**.  \n\n### 4. Output Format  \n\n- Return **only** the letter(s) described above.  \n- When multiple letters are required, separate them with a **single comma** and **no spaces** (e.g., `A,C,E`).  \n- If a single letter is needed, return it alone (e.g., `B`).  \n\n### 5. Optional Reasoning (Do Not Include in Output)  \n\nIf you wish to improve accuracy, you may internally follow this checklist before producing the final answer:  \n\n1. Scan the excerpt for any country name → map to letter.  \n2. If none, scan for city/state/region → map unambiguously to a country.  \n3. If still none, check for “cross‑cultural” wording.  \n4. If still none, check for any non‑listed country or vague region → Y.  \n5. If nothing at all → Z.  \n\n**Do not** output this reasoning; it is for internal use only.\n\n---\n\n**Target Variable:** Country of data acquisition  \n**Excerpt:** `{context}`  \n\n**Answer:**",

To provide a benchmark against the machine learning models, an \nordinary least squares regression (OLS) model with all the available \nsame predictors (in the same manner as the machine learning models) \nwas included. The multiple OLS acts as a comparator with penalised \nregression models by fitting the data without any regularisation, making \nit prone to overfitting compared to models with regularisation. Addi\ntionally, two other comparison models akin to those used in similar \nresearch were fitted (Buckman et al., 2021a). The first was an OLS \nregression model with only the pre-treatment GAD-7 score included, as \ninitial symptom severity is one of the most important factors considered \nby clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes (and allocating treat\nment) for their patients (Amati et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2021b; \nO’Driscoll et al., 2021). Separately, a null model was created using the \nmean post-treatment GAD-7 score in the training and validation dataset \nas the prediction for all test dataset cases. Five models based upon elastic \nnet regularised regression (ENR; Friedman et al., 2010) were included \n(alpha parameters were 0.0; full ridge, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0; full \nlasso), using the ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection oper\nator (lasso) penalisations to reduce overfitting. Two spline regression \nmodels were used: adaptive splines (Friedman, 1991) and adaptive \npolynomial splines (Stone et al., 1997). In addition, two \ndecision-tree-based algorithms were used: random forest (Breiman, \n2001) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., \n2010). Lastly, three support vector machines (SVM) were included with \nlinear, polynomial and radial kernels (Dimitriadou et al., 2009). Full \ndetails of the models are presented in Supplementary Material 1 \n(Table 3). \nSuperLearner (van der Laan et al., 2007), the chosen ensemble \nmodelling tool, uses cross-validation to estimate the predictive perfor\nmance of individual machine learning algorithms, and ultimately de\ntermines the most accurate model within the ensemble.\" (Section 2.4; p.2)",

To provide a benchmark against the machine learning models, an \nordinary least squares regression (OLS) model with all the available \nsame predictors (in the same manner as the machine learning models) \nwas included. The multiple OLS acts as a comparator with penalised \nregression models by fitting the data without any regularisation, making \nit prone to overfitting compared to models with regularisation. Addi\ntionally, two other comparison models akin to those used in similar \nresearch were fitted (Buckman et al., 2021a). The first was an OLS \nregression model with only the pre-treatment GAD-7 score included, as \ninitial symptom severity is one of the most important factors considered \nby clinicians in predicting treatment outcomes (and allocating treat\nment) for their patients (Amati et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2021b; \nO’Driscoll et al., 2021). Separately, a null model was created using the \nmean post-treatment GAD-7 score in the training and validation dataset \nas the prediction for all test dataset cases. Five models based upon elastic \nnet regularised regression (ENR; Friedman et al., 2010) were included \n(alpha parameters were 0.0; full ridge, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0; full \nlasso), using the ridge and least absolute shrinkage and selection oper\nator (lasso) penalisations to reduce overfitting. Two spline regression \nmodels were used: adaptive splines (Friedman, 1991) and adaptive \npolynomial splines (Stone et al., 1997). In addition, two \ndecision-tree-based algorithms were used: random forest (Breiman, \n2001) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART; Chipman et al., \n2010). Lastly, three support vector machines (SVM) were included with \nlinear, polynomial and radial kernels (Dimitriadou et al., 2009). Full \ndetails of the models are presented in Supplementary Material 1 \n(Table 3). \nSuperLearner (van der Laan et al., 2007), the chosen ensemble \nmodelling tool, uses cross-validation to estimate the predictive perfor\nmance of individual machine learning algorithms, and ultimately de\ntermines the most accurate model within the ensemble.\" (Section 2.4; p.2)\n True Answer: ['Y']\n Excerpt: {context} Answer:Example: \"Following that, we use a large database (n = 3385) of trait variables and leadership\n role occupancy to compare the predictive performance of traditional\n (parametric) linear models (LM) versus the non-parametric technique\n of randomforest(RF)analysis.\" (Introduction; p. 2)\n True Answer: ['Y']\n Excerpt: {context} Answer:"

Select “Z” when:  \n   - The excerpt does not mention performance metrics at all.  \n   - The excerpt is so truncated or vague that you cannot ascertain whether an interval is present or absent.  \n   - The excerpt refers to a figure/table without providing the interval values in text.  \n\n4. **No inference or guesswork** – do not infer intervals from p‑values, standard deviations, or narrative descriptions unless the interval is explicitly stated.  \n\n5. **Edge‑case handling** –  \n   - If multiple intervals are reported, the presence of any one suffices for “2”.  \n   - If the interval is reported for a *different* variable (e.g., a demographic characteristic) and not for a performance metric, treat it as “1”.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Output Format  \n\n- Return **only** the chosen code (`1`, `2`, or `Z`).  \n- **Do not** include any explanation, punctuation, or additional characters (e.g., no “Answer:”, no newline before/after).  \n\n**Example valid outputs:** `1` or `2` or `Z`\n\n---\n\n### 6. Optional Reasoning (for internal verification only)  \n\nIf you wish to double‑check your decision, you may briefly note the exact phrase that triggered your choice, but **do not** include this note in the final response.  \n\n---\n\n**Proceed now:** classify the excerpt according to the rules above.  \n\nAnswer:",

We perturbed single predictor variables by randomly changing their values 200 times and keeping all other values constant to calculate the “loss drop” in the test set. The loss drop refers to the increase in the quadratic mean of the difference between the predicted likelihood (ranging from 0% to 100%) and the actual leadership role occupancy (0% or 100%).Note that 11.4% of the individuals in the test set were in a leadership role, which means that if a model were to predict 0% (i.e., no leadership role occupancy) for each individual, the root mean squared error (RMSE) would have been 11.4%. Thus, the RMSE will increase when the perturbations result in a decrease (i.e., drop) in predictive performance.\" (Section \"RQ2a\"; p.6)\n\n\"To further explore the interaction between BFI traits and NFC, we present the RF predictions on the test set against BFI and NFC scores in Fig. 5. In this figure, each person is denoted as either a blue circle or a gray triangle. Blue circles are used when the RF predicts leadership role occupancy (N = 129) and as gray triangles when the RF predicts no leadership role occupancy. As illustrated in Fig. 5, across all interactions, the RF frequently predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals scoring higher (at least 4) on NFC. Further, this higher NFC often resulted in predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals higher on openness (>3.5), conscientiousness (>3.0), and extraversion (>3.0); lower on neuroticism (>3.0); and not too high on agreeableness (<4.5). Note that these findings are largely in line with the accumulated local effects plotted in Fig. 3, in which we visualized the effects of each trait separately.\" (Section RQ2c\"; p.8)\n\n\"The importance of interactions between traits in predicting leadership role occupancy is visualized in Fig. 4a. This figure shows that NFC has the strongest interaction effect (H-statistic), meaning that interactions between NFC and the other traits contribute the most to leadership role occupancy predictions. To better understand the interactions between NFC and the other traits, we computed the H-statistic for each pair with NFC. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the interaction between openness and NFC contributed the most in predicting leadership role occupancy, which we explore next.\" (Section \"RQ2c\"; p. 8)",

We perturbed single predictor variables by randomly changing their values 200 times and keeping all other values constant to calculate the “loss drop” in the test set. The loss drop refers to the increase in the quadratic mean of the difference between the predicted likelihood (ranging from 0% to 100%) and the actual leadership role occupancy (0% or 100%).Note that 11.4% of the individuals in the test set were in a leadership role, which means that if a model were to predict 0% (i.e., no leadership role occupancy) for each individual, the root mean squared error (RMSE) would have been 11.4%. Thus, the RMSE will increase when the perturbations result in a decrease (i.e., drop) in predictive performance.\" (Section \"RQ2a\"; p.6)\n\n\"To further explore the interaction between BFI traits and NFC, we present the RF predictions on the test set against BFI and NFC scores in Fig. 5. In this figure, each person is denoted as either a blue circle or a gray triangle. Blue circles are used when the RF predicts leadership role occupancy (N = 129) and as gray triangles when the RF predicts no leadership role occupancy. As illustrated in Fig. 5, across all interactions, the RF frequently predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals scoring higher (at least 4) on NFC. Further, this higher NFC often resulted in predicted leadership role occupancy for individuals higher on openness (>3.5), conscientiousness (>3.0), and extraversion (>3.0); lower on neuroticism (>3.0); and not too high on agreeableness (<4.5). Note that these findings are largely in line with the accumulated local effects plotted in Fig. 3, in which we visualized the effects of each trait separately.\" (Section RQ2c\"; p.8)\n\n\"The importance of interactions between traits in predicting leadership role occupancy is visualized in Fig. 4a. This figure shows that NFC has the strongest interaction effect (H-statistic), meaning that interactions between NFC and the other traits contribute the most to leadership role occupancy predictions. To better understand the interactions between NFC and the other traits, we computed the H-statistic for each pair with NFC. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the interaction between openness and NFC contributed the most in predicting leadership role occupancy, which we explore next.\" (Section \"RQ2c\"; p. 8)\n True Answer: ['Y']\n Excerpt: {context} Answer:"
