Target Variable  \n**“Data preparation steps performed to train/test set separately”**\n\n- **Code 1 (Jointly)** – The excerpt explicitly states that **at least one** data‑preparation step (e.g., mean imputation, scaling, feature engineering) was applied **jointly** to the training and test data *before* the split or without separate handling.  \n- **Code 2 (Separately)** – The excerpt explicitly states that all data‑preparation steps were performed **independently** on the training set and on the test set (e.g., “we normalized the training set and then applied the same parameters to the test set” *or* “each set was pre‑processed separately”).  \n- **Code 0 (Not reported)** – The excerpt gives **no information** about whether preparation steps were joint or separate, **or** it mentions preparation steps but does not specify whether they were applied jointly or separately.  \n- **Code ‑99 (Not applicable)** – The study does **not use a validation split** (e.g., “no validation”, “internal study, no split”, “all data used for training”).  \n\n---\n\n### 2.

Edge‑Case Clarifications\n\n| Situation | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Both joint and separate steps are described (e.g., “mean imputation was done jointly, but scaling was done separately”) | Output **1** (Jointly) because any joint step makes the variable “Jointly”. |\n| The excerpt states “no validation” or “all data used for training” and no split is performed | Output **‑99**. |\n| The excerpt mentions a split but gives no detail on preprocessing | Output **0**. |\n| The excerpt is empty or unrelated to preprocessing | Output **Z**. |\n\n---\n\n### 4.

From the supplied excerpt, you must assign **exactly one code** that reflects how the authors describe the “best‑performing model” in a comparative evaluation.\n\n**Coding Scheme**  \n\n| Code | Meaning |\n|------|----------|\n| **1** | The authors state that *no* algorithm outperforms the others (i.e., they do not identify a single best‑performing model). |\n| **99**| The authors name a specific algorithm as best‑performing **even though** the reported performance metrics of the other algorithms contradict that claim. In this case you must also provide the algorithm’s name in a comment (see “Output Format”). |\n| **Z** | The excerpt contains **no information** about which algorithm, if any, is considered best‑performing. |\n\n**Instructions**  \n\n1. **Read the excerpt carefully.** Use only the information explicitly presented in the excerpt. Do **not** infer, guess, or use external knowledge.  \n2. **Determine the appropriate code** according to the definitions above.  \n3. **If the excerpt mentions a specific algorithm as best‑performing and the performance numbers clearly support that claim**, assign **99** **only** when the numbers *contradict* the claim. If the numbers are consistent with the claim, treat the situation as “no contradiction” and code **1** (no algorithm outperforms) only when the authors explicitly say no algorithm is superior.  \n4. **If the excerpt does not discuss best‑performing models at all**, return **Z**.  \n5. **If the excerpt is ambiguous** (e.g., it hints at a best model but does not state it clearly), treat this as missing information and return **Z**.  \n\n**Output Format**  \n\n- Return **only** the required code (`1`, `99`, or `Z`).  \n- If you return `99`, append a comment on the same line after a single space, using the exact algorithm name as given in the excerpt.  \n  - Example: `99 RandomForest`  \n\nNo additional text, explanations, or formatting should be included.\n\n**Edge‑Case Handling**  \n\n- *Multiple algorithms claimed as best*: Treat as “no algorithm outperforms others” → code **1**.  \n- *Contradictory performance data*: Use code **99** with the named algorithm.  \n- *No performance data provided*: If an algorithm is named as best but no numbers are shown, this is not a contradiction; code **1** (unless the authors explicitly say no algorithm is best).  \n- *Zero or missing values in related variables* (e.g., if a preceding variable indicates “not applicable”): Follow the same rule—code **Z** only when the excerpt truly lacks any best‑model information.\n\n**Excerpt**  \n{context}\n\n**Answer:**",

Your task is to classify information from research paper excerpts according to a predefined coding scheme.\nInstructions:\nSelect exactly one number that best applies, based strictly on the provided document.\nReturn only the number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) with no explanation or additional text.\nIf the requested information is not present in the excerpt, answer with Z.\nDo not guess or infer.\nTarget Variable: Generalizability of model performance and variable importance measures\nDescription: ; \nAnswer Options: 0: No statements regarding generalizability\n1: Statements are extended to data outside the data sampling frame - Authors claim their models generalize to populations or contexts beyond the one studied (e.g., a model trained on a U.S. sample is said to generalize across cultures).\n2: Statements are made with respect to the data analyzed / generalizability outside the sampling frame is questioned. - Claims are restricted to the analyzed data and/or generalization beyond it is explicitly questioned (e.g., results based on one region are stated not to generalize elsewhere).\nExcerpt:\n{context}\nAnswer:\n\n# Examples:\nExample 1:\nExtract from paper: The random forest classifier attained an accuracy of 82 % on the held‑out validation set, with feature importance rankings highlighting age and BMI as the top predictors.<\\/context1/>\nTrue Answer: 0\nExample 2:\nExtract from paper: Our deep‑learning model, trained on a nationally representative U.S. health survey, demonstrated comparable performance when applied to datasets from Canada and the United Kingdom, suggesting broad cross‑cultural applicability.<\\/context2/>\nTrue Answer: 1"
