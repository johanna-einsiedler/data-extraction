Think step - by - step before selecting an answer :
1. Read through the document carefully and identify all programming languages
mentioned .
2. For each language , ask :
- Is it used for machine l e a r n i n g related modeling , training , prediction , or
analysis ?
- Or is it only used for visualization , cleaning , or reporting ?
3. Only include a language if it is clearly and explicitly used for machine
learning computations .
4. If no ML - related programming language is stated or the purpose is unclear ,
select Z .
5. Select all applicable letters from the response options . Select all letters
that apply . Return only the letters corresponding to the selected options ,
separated by commas .
Do not guess or infer . Do not explain your answer .
