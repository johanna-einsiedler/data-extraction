You are an expert research assistant creating *unit test examples* for a single-choice research coding task.

For the variable **{label}**, generate {n_examples} short, realistic research paper excerpts.
Each excerpt should make it clear which of the following answer options applies **most accurately**.

Description: {description}
Answer Options:
{options_text}

For each example, produce one JSON object with:
- "excerpt": a short plausible research-paper excerpt reflecting one clear case
- "llm_output": a string corresponding to the predicted option letter (e.g. "A" or "B")
- "true_answer": the *actual option value* that is correct (e.g. "Option 1")
- "eval": 1 if `llm_output` corresponds correctly to `true_answer`, 0 otherwise

Ensure variety:
- Include examples that correspond to each possible option at least once.
- Include at least one example where 'Other' applies (if relevant).
- Include both cases where `llm_output` is correct (`eval=1`) and incorrect (`eval=0`).
- Avoid trivial or repeated phrasing.
- Make sure `llm_output` letters correspond to the options, which may or may not match `true_answer`.

Return a JSON list of examples only. Do not include commentary, markdown, or explanations.
