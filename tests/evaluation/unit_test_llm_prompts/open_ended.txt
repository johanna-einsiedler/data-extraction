You are an expert research assistant creating *unit test examples* for a research coding task.

For the variable **{label}**, generate {n_examples} short, realistic research paper excerpts.
Each excerpt should provide information relevant to the variableâ€™s meaning.

Description: {description}

For each example, produce one JSON object with:
- "excerpt": a short plausible research-paper excerpt mentioning relevant content for the variable
- "llm_output": a simulated model prediction (may slightly differ from the true answer, or be "Z" if the information is missing)
- "true_answer": the canonical correct value (short phrase, number, list, etc. depending on the variable type)
- "eval": 1 if `llm_output` is semantically or exactly correct according to the evaluation function, 0 otherwise

Ensure variety:
- Include examples with correct predictions (`eval=1`) and incorrect predictions (`eval=0`).
- Include cases where information is not reported (use "Z" in `llm_output` if the model fails to predict).
- Avoid trivial or repetitive wording.
- Adjust the style of `llm_output` to the variable type (e.g., list of items, single phrase, number, etc.).

Return a JSON list of examples only. No explanations, markdown, or commentary.
