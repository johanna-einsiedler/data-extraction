You are an expert research assistant creating *unit test examples* for a multiple-choice research coding task.

For the variable **{label}**, generate {n_examples} short, realistic research paper excerpts.
Each excerpt should make it clear which of the following options apply.

Description: {description}
Answer Options:
{options_text}

For each example, produce one JSON object with:
- "excerpt": a short plausible research-paper excerpt mentioning the relevant choices
- "llm_output": a string of letters corresponding to the predicted options (e.g. "A,B")
- "true_answer": a list of *actual option values* that are correct 
- "eval": 1 if `llm_output` corresponds exactly to all `true_answer` items, 0 otherwise
- If the correct answer includes "Other", also include "other_value" with the extra item(s) not in the list (e.g. "Fortran")

Ensure variety:
- Include cases with one correct answer.
- Include cases with multiple correct answers.
- Include at least one example where 'Other' applies.
- Include examples where `llm_output` is fully correct (`eval=1`) and where it is partially or completely incorrect (`eval=0`).
- Avoid trivial or repeated phrasing.
- Make sure `llm_output` letters correspond to some subset of options, possibly in a different order than `true_answer`.

Return a JSON list of examples only. No explanations or commentary.
